31,8,fairbairns,33,a good couple of days for qcbc, in particular for the novice men.  the 2nd men achieved the accolade of being crowned fastest men's novice VIII, while the 3rd men won the plate event.  The novice women also did us proud again - achieving their third 2nd place of the term.  To round it off, in senior fairbairns the blokes were able to put out 2 fours in the top ten - a sure sign of strength in depth. Due to injuries in the squad, the senior women were only able to put out one IV, but still finished in the top ten of college first IVs,2

48,8,lent bumps - saturday,66,a thoroughly mixed set of bumps for QCBC.  on a completely positive note the boat club now has all her boats where they should be, with the rise of the 3rd men into the bottom of the third division.  <br><br>sadly the women's boat club was hindered by having stronger opposition all around them - these races came too early during a time where the boat club is recovering from losing several may colours.  However, with every set of disappointing bumps races comes a turning point that can in the end prove vital to future success.  <br><br>the men's boat club enjoyed unparalleled success, at least when compared to recent years, with a total of up 10.  this is due to a good continuity of novice rowers from last term training very hard - and the third men are very worthy of their captain's blades.  hopefully this can continue to next term, and with the return of some triallists / mays colours, queens' should produce a 4th VIII good enough to get on. here's for up 16 next term!

138,10,Queens' Ergo Comp,1, The annual Queens' Ergo competition-sponsored by Arthur D. Little- was another massive success this year with 968 novice rowers from across the university taking part.

The event sees crews of 8 novice rowers battle it out in a relay race against other colleges, with each rower completing a 500 meter sprint, before generally collapsing off the ergometer (rowing machine) exhausted and handing over to the next rower. Up to 16 crews were thrashing manically up and down their machines at any one time and with a total of 121 crews this was the biggest competition yet and easily the second biggest indoor rowing event in the country.  

It must be said that in terms of sheer noise and excitement levels it rivalled all other university sporting competitions going. The atmosphere amongst the crowd and the competitors was electric and it was clear from the start: this was a fun competition but it was also a serious one.  College flags were draped from the balconies and chants echoed around the arena, whilst team-mates and highly-excitable lower boats captains screamed encouragement over the pulsating beats of such classic sporting anthems as 'Eye of the Tiger'.  

In the Men's competition LMBC were able to hold off a strong Jesus crew throughout the final to lay claim to the title of fastest novice ergers on the Cam. Whilst in the Women's event Emma put in a similarly impressive display to beat all the other colleges. In the lower divisions LMBC C won the Men's event and Newnham C the women's. Special mention must go to Adam Sergeant from Homerton who managed to snap his erg and yet still record the fastest individual time of the evening. The fastest individual women's time was recorded by Elizabeth Smee from LMBC who powered through in 1 minute 34 seconds. With an impressive set of performances LMBC thus demonstrated their intentions to other colleges, showing that they will be the crew to beat in Fairbairns.  

Most important of all, as the crews dispersed from the arena at the end of the night with 'Final Countdown' echoing in their ears it was clear that they had experienced something epic and would be enjoying their college rowing for years to come.,2

173,10,Easter Training Camp,73,<b>17/04/06-22/04/06: Shrewsbury</b>
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/qcbc/pictures/index.php?seasonid=10&crewname=Easter+Holidays&eventname=Easter+Training+Camp"><img src="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/qcbc/pictures/10/Easter Holidays/Easter Training Camp/DSC_0002.JPG" align="right" border=0></a>
Given the fecal aromatic aura surrounding both squads by the end of the Easter training camp, one can only assume that this year's crop of rowers only brought one change of rowing gear. So quite how the ladies of QCBC managed to bring such large suitcases will remain a mystery, only partly explained by Mills's industrial sized bar of Dairy Milk. It was also a miracle that so many found the place - despite the rigorous academic training of the Cambridge University Geography Department, it appeared that George had gone over the lines when colouring in his map of England and was convinced that Shrewsbury was in Wales. For the final time, it's not.<br><br>
 
The facilities at Shrewsbury were quite outstanding, and we made good use of them. 30 minutes of steady state rowing without stopping, with a coach merely feet away in a launch was quite a revelation. Granted, none of our coaches will be entering the National Power Boat Driving Championships any time soon, but the mud from the bank washed off the front of the launches quite easily so Helen, your secret's safe with us. The river was completely empty of other boats. Apart, of course, from the odd schoolboy eight. Our boys put them back in their box, however. Oh yes. As they lined up on the start the mighty men of the QCBC glanced over at their opponents and smiled. "This is going to be a walkover", they thought, chuckling at what the massed ranks of spectators on the bank would think. And of course they were quite right, it was a walkover. The Shrewsbury School J15 VIII absolutely nailed them. Consolation came when we realised that at least half the schoolboy crew had actually celebrated their 15th birthdays. Because being beaten by 14 year olds would have been embarrassing, you understand.<br><br>
 
Each morning the coaches and coxes were treated to the view of Ellie poking her bum in the air expectantly, as we did a core session. This was followed by 2 or 3 outings or technical ergs, lunch, Neighbours, and occasionally Pingu (though Cf had gone home at this point). The only two alternative training sessions were a 6 mile run upstream for the boys on Monday afternoon which knackered them out for the entire week (though Matt Young decided that 6 miles wasn't enough, and promptly returned an hour after everyone else having discovered an alternative source of the river Severn just east of the Snowdonia National Park), and a football session. The football was going really well for the first couple of minutes - one of the girls even managed to make contact with the ball as she swung wildly - until Matt, obviously still keen to prove a point after his marathon training a couple of days before, slid into the concrete footpath. I personally had never seen anyone's tibia before, and neither, it appears, had Cath - obviously 5 years of medical training and 18 months on the wards hadn't quite prepared her for the sight of blood and guts. She'll be an incredibly reassuring doctor if her response to every injury is "EEEEUUUUUGGGGHHHH!!!". Fortunately A&E in Shrewsbury is a darn sight better than the MPhil course in queueing at Addenbrookes and an hour later he was practically jogging down the stairs of the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital to pick up his prescription.<br><br>
 
Perhaps the only other event of note was the final evening. Having given up on a night out in Shrewsbury due to a lack of taxis, our intrepid bunch of boaties decided to get pissed in the accommodation before wandering down dark country roads into the bright neon lights of the metropolis of Much Wenlock. Beef Szechuan and chips for dinner, a visit to the Spar for more supplies, hitching a lift back with some chavs, a few rounds of I Have Never, and before you know it most people were naked after 5 minutes of strip poker. I think the Christian Church group in the barn across the courtyard appreciated the view. And if any pictures make it onto Facebook, you're dead. Analysis of the photos which do survive shows that Alice did a good job of pretending to be asleep to avoid getting jiggy with James, but sadly there is no video evidence of Justin's death defying leap headfirst down the stairs. We're hoping that the hole he made in the wall with his head won't get noticed by the owners.<br><br>
 
All-in-all it was a real success so thank you to the organisers, the coaches, and the dickheads who have given us all these stories to tell. Lots of rowing got done, there was much giggling, and things are looking good for both squads for the Mays. As long as no schoolboys enter.
