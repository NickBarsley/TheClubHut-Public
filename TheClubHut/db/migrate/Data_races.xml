		<result>224th of 412</result>
		<report>The Boar's Head entered the tideway eights' head 2003, with a crew full of young blood – six of the crew were current students, five of whom were competing for the Boar's for the first time.  Gareth, Shailen and John Webb provided some valuable experience and completed the crew.&lt;br&gt;Although the older Boars seem to be rowing less and less, they fitted well into the crew (the rest of whom had been training on the tideway for a couple of days before-hand), demonstrating that Queens' technique has been pretty consistent over the years.  With one outing as a crew before the race we got the feel of rowing together – in true Boar's Head style.&lt;br&gt;The race itself went pretty smoothly and we were helped by favourable conditions – bright and warm with not much wind!&lt;br&gt;The emphasis was on finding a sustainable pace, maintaining a reasonable rating and not making any major errors.  We succeeded on all these fronts, rowing over the course at 30-32 spm, but the boat lacked some of the 'zing' we were hoping for.  Christian as cox'n steered a good course and although we were overtaken by a good school VIII, we overtook several other crews - and thrashed Black Prince!&lt;br&gt;We finished 224th over all, 49th out of 89 S3 crews, with a time of 19:43.50.  It would have been nice to finish in the top 200, but with 3 guys who hadn't been in a boat since Fairbairns, and a result nearly as good as the Boars have ever achieved at the HoRR, we were happy with the result.						</report>

		<report>for the most part of the previous rowing year, we'd known this would be the crunch day.  would we be able to get First and Third? - it was always going to be the key to our blades.  unfortunately our race plan to grind them down didn't really get us anywhere, because we hadn't counted on Jesus being caught by grassy.  we then had some fun avoiding the carnage with some rowers having to stop.  clare pulled up on us as we were spakking around, but we managed to settle back into a rhythm at 32, which was incredibly, enough to hold them off.  once they'd bumped out we rowed home to console ourselves with another year without blades.  oh well.</report>

		<report>with the disappointment of another mays without blades behind us, we set out planning a glory bump just outside the plough - intending to hold back until the correct time.  unfortunately spanners that we were we were still chasing them hard at the plough.  however as we got up the reach, they moved over to the ditton meadows side of the river, so we (well the cox) decided to stay in the clear water on the towpath side and try to overtake.  but he got bored and so steered into them once the bow man was level with their cox.</report>

		<report>By all accounts an adequate day at the office.  Having set off from Putney we quickly had a nice rhythm going in the boat and things were feeling rosy.  We started the race determined to really push ourselves between Chiswick and Barnes to set ourselves up nicely for Corney Reach, which we did well, settling nicely at 32-33.  By Barnes we'd settled into our race steady rating at 30, which we would keep until the last push. Past Hammersmith things did start to get a bit crappy, but we were driven on by a fast 4+ coming at us from behind, which picked the boat up well and took us to the finish.  Consensus was that if the boat had had more than just the row down to the start to prepare for the race, we could have done better to keep our high position in the S3+C category.</report>

		<report>Quite a melancholic race.  Having got in only one outing since four's head, we weren't expecting much from the day - just racing to get another outing in really.  This meant that we went into the race with a rather conservative plan.  Furthermore there was no rating on the cox box, so we didn't really know how fast we were going.  In the end we got to the end of the race and concluded that there was a lot more in the tank - we could have gone faster.</report>

		<result>beat Clare in round one, then lost to Homerton</result>
		<report>On the start there was much faffing with lining up boats and eventually both boats were level, side by side, and straight. The marshalls then gave a very quick: "attention, Go!" which caught the Queens' crew unaware. Clare pulled away slightly, which was quickly rectified as The Strokes laid down the power in the water. A VERY close battle then
started coming up the reach - with The Strokes ahead by the narrowest of margins. At this point Clare crabbed - and easied, giving The Strokes the rest of the reach to ride home in style.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After a healthy rest in the pub getting warm, the next boat to face was
Homerton Seniors. However, in their defense they did have a whole ONE novice in their boat. Hmmmmm. On the start they started with half a length between us and them. Having learnt the lessons from last time - Queens' nailed it off the start and settled very well from the stride.  Homerton held their distance for 1/2 the reach until Vicky made a rhythm
up 1 down 1 call, at which point the whole crew responded brilliantly. The rhythm was immense, and took a foot off the Homerton crew with each
stroke. Unfortunately the lead they had had from the start was just too big - and although we had overlap as we crossed the line, the end result was a loss. Returned home happy with the racing - and very very very cold.																		</report>

		<result>lost in 1st round to Hughes Hall</result>
		<report>After a very powerful and tidy start the MBB settled in a very solid powerful rhythm. After 2/3rds of the course a healthy lead of a boat
length had been opened up. Unfortunately things fell apart at this point, allowing Hughes Hall back into the race. An incredibly close battle for the finish ensued - going Hughes' way by just one foot on the finish line. Bizarrely both crews felt the need to row on full pressure until well after the railway bridge before eventually holding it up to prevent a game of chicken with a barge. Quality rowing with many lessons learnt for next time.						</report>

		<result>lost in 1st round to Trinity Hall</result>
		<report>This was a classic example of the other crew starting 1/2 a boat length ahead. Off the start we held them well, until 1/2 way down the reach where they set a rock-solid rhythm and ours started to faulter - leading to loss by a boat length.  It was very gutsy rowing against an A crew twice the size of the $5s. Thanks to Ed from the MBB boat for subbing in last minute.												</report>

		<result>Lost to Emma</result>
		<report>After a very good start we were about 3/4 of a length ahead of Emma. Managed to maintain this position over half the race, where we lost some speed and Emma started gaining on us.
However we managed to hold things together until unfortunate steering caused both crews' blades to clash, Emma managed to get ahead after this incident, and held their position until the finishing line ( about 40 metres further). Overall a very well rowed race.

		<result>winners of S2.4+</result>
		<report>In their fourth consecutive year of racing at this event, the Boars achieved the club’s most successful results to date, a clean sweep of Senior 4, Senior 3, and Senior 2 coxed fours, winning all the events entered. Most of the space in Jim’s boot was taken up by the fifteen glass tankards awarded as prizes. A top-level result all round! &lt;br&gt;

While the Senior 3 contest between "3 star" and "5 star" was billed as a close one, the gap was wider than expected (11 seconds), mainly due to the fact that "3 star"'s (female) driver did not quite work out how to change up a gear in the last 500m! This ensured the mythical Majithia trophy (awarded to the faster Senior 3 crew) went to "5 star". &lt;br&gt;

Looking at the unofficial seat racing results, Chaz Murray and Sam Clarke proved to be the fastest pair of the day. Rather embarrassingly, points-heavy "7 star" was beaten by "1 star", which was one second faster over the course.						</report>

		<result>7th, timed at 12:16, 5th of 12 college IVs</result>
		<report>After some ups and downs in training, we came into fairbairns in quite a relaxed fashion - neither expecting to win, nor to be rubbish, so all we could do is go out and enjoy it.  There was a well rehearsed plan to split the race up into 6 two minute pieces - unfortunately we decided not to put the stroke seat in the correct place after we washed the boat: so we had a fun race - there were no ratings and we didn't have a clue how long we'd been racing for.  it went okay though - overtaking jesus just above the railway bridge was a bit of fun, then the long grind down the reach felt nice and powerful.  there was really nothing left in the tank at the end, so we did do as well as we could have hoped.  a few seconds faster would have improved our placing dramatically, but at least magdalene didn't exactly trounce us.</report>

		<report>Being the fourth time we were out together as a crew, and with new rigging we didn't expect much, but we were suprised. In the end it turned out to be a neat and steady row, with some minor mishaps, probably due to the excitement of a possible overtaking of Tit Hall, which we managed in front of the P&amp;E. Overall a fun but tiring experience!</report>

		<report>&lt;b&gt;Winners of Novice Fairbairns 2003&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Building up to almost a sprint start the VIII flew past the boat houses rating high-thirties. By the time they passed Selwyn boat houses this had strode to a solid race pace rythm of 31. With clean blade work, long strokes, and good timing, Chesterton soon came up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helen made some really good calls pushing off bridges, and each push the crew changed the rating as a whole driving the boat onwards. Coming under the railway bridge the crew had already given everything but found something left to sprint down the reach picking the rating right up to high thirties. Blade work deteriorated slightly and a crab was caught. Having quickly recovered the crew sought to make up for time lost by really nailing the last 200m at an incredible speed.</report>

&lt;b&gt;Quarter Final - lost to Jesus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Moving into the quarter finals put the firsts on a crash course with the seconds in the semi final.  Before that though was the not so mediocre task of beating the mighty Jesus.  We started off nicely and did well to start pushing them away.  At best we had three quarters of a length on them.  Then Jesus started showing their form, and at the same time the cox box went kaput(sp?).  Rhythm and timing in the boat started to disappear, and without the cox box it wasn't possible get the boat back in time.  However we somehow managed to hold them off right to the end, losing in the end by around, well, a foot.  This was a great pity - it would have been great to see an all queens' semi final.																							</report>

&lt;b&gt;Semi Final - lost to Jesus A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Driven on by the fact that we were racing the crew that had denied us the chance of an all queens' semi-final, the seconds row magnificently.  By half way through the race we had the cox level with their bowman, but as in the quarter final against Queens' A, Jesus kept calm and brought it back, rowing well right to the finish.												</report>

&lt;b&gt;Second round - beat LMBC D&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After only 15 strokes Queens' C was roughly a length ahead off the start. LMBC D had an apawling start, followed a few strokes later by one of them crabbing, and then their blade flying out the gate. This allowed Queens' to open up a 5 boat length lead. With really good timing and pushing themselves the whole length of the course Queens' pushed on to the finish line, finishing a very long way ahead of Maggie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Quarter final - beat CCAT B&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For much of the time we spent marshalling we thought this would be a non-event, simply because the CCAT 7 men had lost a clam, and that they would race with only six rowers.  This would have been a bit disappointing, but the fates brought us the honour of beating them at full strength.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Semi final - beat Clare B (I think)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
another convincing win&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Final - beat LMBC C&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
a nice way to cap off the day with a victory over the men in red.						</report>

Queens' started the race off showing good form and managed to move away.  It looked as though we would hold on, since the advantage of the inside coming under the railway bridge didn't seem to help emma.  But they came through to win a very close race by about a quarter of a length.						</report>

		<report>this was a scratch crew put together so that a few of the lazy bastards in the club could get a race in.  after a few outings, we weren't rowing particularly well, but come the race the general power of the boat brought us most of our speed.  the only exciting thing that happened was catching Pembroke at the gas works - much shouting ensued, and we probably could have done better without those blades clashes</report>

		<report>The Boars once again made the annual pilgrimage to Boston, anxious to make an impact in their third successive year of participation in this exciting event. Yet again, the weather did not let them down, with blues skies in the chill autumn breeze making the practice time on the River Charles as enjoyable as ever.&lt;br&gt;

An improved crew, with the new faces of Sam Clarke and David Clarke, and a local MIT cox Shelli Farhadian (fresh from an exchange year at Queens' College), was keen to build on the fine race performance of the 2001 crew entry. To help it along, the crew was given a boost by the loan of an Empacher for the first time from Harvard coach Charlie Butt and boatman Jo, seen below modelling their new Boars Head caps, a small gift from the crew to show their appreciation of the hospitality so graciously offered by Charlie and Jo each year.&lt;br&gt;

After the customary visits to Banana Republic, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Pinocchio's and the Green House, race day loomed, with the Boars going off in the men’s club eights division at its new scheduled time of 12 noon on Saturday. Starting twelfth, the Boars struck a sustainable rate 32 over the first sector of the course. This year the extra fitness of the crew showed itself in a very fast second sector, and a fine overtaking maneouvre past crew number 10 just past Newell Boathouse. In blustery and challenging conditions, the Boars rowed a powerful race to finish 13th overall, their highest placing yet in this event, and within 5.1% of the winning time of ASR Nereus, the Dutch National Squad. The Boars also finished as the highest placed UK crew, in the process giving a mighty 75-second shoo-ing to arch rivals Black Prince.</report>

		<report>This was the first race of the term for us and early on in the crew’s
development.  On the day conditions were terrible and the start was
considerably delayed.  Eventually we got under way into a large head wind,
starting reasonably, but not as well as hoped, with rhythm and run lacking.
Eventually we pulled together down plough reach in a bit of a wind break
before we headed on to the reach in to a huge head wind. We responded to it
with pure brute force and came to the line 7th out of 10.  Not the result we
had hoped for but a result we will improve on rapidly.</report>

		<report>Just a week after a mediocre performance at Newnham, the 1st VIII was keen to
deliver the goods over the 5km course at Peterborough. Sadly, the conditions on
the Nene were as bad as they had been the previous week, and the crew was
tested by a strong headwind and choppy water. Since the course was so straight
and featureless, and because we didn't know exactly how long it would take, we
decided not to split the race into small chunks for pacing purposes; instead,
we concentrated on different aspects of technique and aimed to hold it at 28
throughout the race. After a strong start we hit a decent rhythm and before
long had reeled in the Curlew crew ahead. A strong push past and then off them
picked the boat speed right up, but at the expense of the rhythm and technique,
which faltered in the later stages. An untimely crab near the end further
hampered our time of 20:01 which, while good enough to beat Peterhouse, saw us
between 20 and 30 seconds adrift of Tit Hall, Magdalene and Emma. More
pleasing, however, was the fact that we beat the Oxford college crew chasing
us! In all then, it was a valuable learning experience - but we must improve
drastically before the Bumps.</report>

		<report>Unfortunately, things did not go to plan for the 1st women yet again. Having not raced as a crew, we were looking forward to an opportuntity to compare ourselves to the other college crews. However, conditions while marshalling were horrendous, and a collision with several other boats pushed us towards the bank where submerged rocked put a large hole in our stern. The Patroness rapidly filled with water, but we decided to continue and completed the race with both the cox and stroke seats submerged. Although the crew's heart was not in the race and we were simply nursing our injured boat home, we were pleased to have completed the course and to have not recorded the slowest time of the day</report>

		<report>a thrilling race saw queens' begin well.  with st edmund's having bumped new hall quite early, we had the entire course to chase the homerton first boat.  at this time catz were nowhere to be seen, and we looked strong for the bump.  though queens' closed on homerton, catz eventually started drawing us in.  it emerged that they had fallen back due to a crab.  queens' were able to put up a good fight along plough reach, but with just after the plough, catz got the bump on the apex of ditton.&lt;p class=pname&gt;Christian&lt;/p&gt;</report>

		<report>A tough draw in the first round saw us line up against Emma 1 at 9am, just 8
hours after the bop finished after the previous night's Half-Way Dinner.
Absent from the crew was Nick Barsley, with a back strain, so Hugh moved up
to the 7 seat and James Pickett came out of retirement to fill the 8th slot.
A disastrous start, thanks to huge ripping at the catch, saw Emma forge
ahead immediately, and within 10 strokes were almost a length ahead. Sadly
they were to retain this lead all the way through the race, though they were
made to work for it - some really strong pushes added huge boat speed and
kept us right on their tail all the way to the end. In all then, it was a
good strong row from a 1st VIII which is rapidly improving with every
outing - Emma were just that little bit better on the day.</report>

		<report>This was our first opportunity to race as a crew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In the first round we were drawn against Magdalene II.  After a poor start there was open water between us.  However, after the Railway bridge we found some rhythm.  Despite suffering two crabs during the race we powered through to finish about half a length up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In the second round we were drawn against Jesus II.  This was a tough race but an attainable target.  Again our start was not up to standard and there was just open water between us at the Railway bridge.  We started to close the gap but unfortunately lost our form in the crucial last 100m where I believe we would have overtaken.  In the end we lost
by about a quarter of a length.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Overall this was an encouraging performance and we will build on it before Bumps.</report>

		<report>The crew was looking forward to our first race together, despite the fact that some of us were sill suffering the effects of Halfway Dinner the night before! In the first race, Selwyn 2 got off the start faster than us, but we gained on them almost immediately. We pulled ahead all the way up the Reach, leaving Selwyn a length behind by the Railway Bridge. By the finish line, both crews were racing in the same lane, with a clear two lengths between us. &lt;br&gt;
Encouraged by our first victory we next faced Fitz 2. With a much neater and more controlled start, we had pulled ahead by halfway up the Reach, and following Fitz's subsequent catastrophic crash into the meadow-side
bank, wound down after the Railway Bridge and paddled on lightly for an easy win.&lt;br&gt;
With over a two hour gap before facing Jesus 2 we started the semi-final race cold and tired. We gave it our all, however, and whilst unable to recapture the ground lost to Jesus off the start, we pushed them hard throughout the whole race, losing by just over a length.&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the day displayed a spirited and commendable effort by all - a promising prospect for Bumps.</report>

		<result>reached the final and lost to lmbc III</result>
		<report>As the first opportunity to race as a crew together Pembroke was an excellent oportunity both to get some race experience and to check out our opposition for bumps. With a very lucky draw passing straight through the
first round we were drawn against Magdalene III. The power and determination of the crew was evident as straight off the start the
Magdalene crew were left behind and before the railway bridge had been reached the crew had wound it down. Our Semi-Final was against FaT IV who pulled out giving us a place in the final. LMBC III were a strong crew and
despite a very good start and leading for most of the long reach the lack of race experience showed in the Queens' boat and LMBC pulled ahead by a length to win. It was a gutsy fast and determined effort by all concerned and an encouraging prospect for bumps.</report>

		<result>bumped emma II</result>
		<report>We started on station 13 back by the lock. The gun went on time and we rolled into out quick but not exactly elegant start. We pulled half a
length out on Christs II behind us and held steady with Emma II in front. There was no pressure from behind - this was our race. It was going to be a close though as Emma II were catching Corpus ahead of them faster than we were catching Emma II. We got the first whistle at first post corner and the crew settled into a strong rhythm to take the next
half length round grassy. Emma were looking scrappy at this stage having given it all early on - they were broken men! The inevitable bump came outside the plough.&lt;br&gt;

		<report>Owing to some confusion at the start, due to the lack of anyone counting us down, our start was not as good as it could have been, although we were gaining on Homerton anyway.&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, as the balance and timing was still off, we crabbed and had to hold it up and start again, allowing Corpus to almost get overlap. &lt;br&gt;After our second start, however, Corpus were pushed away successfully, and we could concentrate on
catching up with Homerton again. Whilst we were gaining on them up through the Gut and Plough Reach, they pulled ahead again on the Long Reach. Despite being tired, we pushed through right the way to the Railway Bridge to finish an admirable row-over. Today was unfortunate, but we showed we have the stamina and strength for a good row-over, and will be looking for a much better start and an early bump on Thursday.</report>

		<report>The 1st men got off to a terrific start and were up within a length of caius II after about 7 strokes. We had a slightly dodgy stride as we hit the choppy water coming round the corner, but there was no way caius were going to hold us off for long. We were so quick that the bank party fell behind with their whistles; nevertheless, a slightly disbelieving crew responded snappily to my
call for a bumps ten and we duly parked our bows on their stern before the motorway bridge - a 30 stroke bump isn't bad for the 1st Division! Textbook stuff, but most importantly we looked dangerous when compared with pembroke behind us and clare ahead, who we chase tomorrow after their (hopefully!)
exhausting row-over.</report>

		<report>The men's 1st VIII enjoyed a cracking row to bump clare I coming round ditton corner onto the reach. A solid start saw us hold station on clare, but despite settling into a solid rhythm they pushed off us and held us all the way up first post reach. We took them down to
one whistle as we pushed out of first post corner, and capitalised on a poor line from their cox to come within a canvas by grassy. A bumps ten out of the corner saw us come tantalisingly close, but clare held their nerve and put in a final last ditch attempt to hold us off as we just failed to make contact. There was no question that our fitness and strength would prevail, however, and we gained overlap coming past the plough. This time we made no mistake on our bumps ten and gave their
stern a good thumping before their cox finally conceded. Superb though the bump itself was, it was great to see selwyn, who we chase tomorrow, only a length off clare at the bump. Tomorrow's racing should be exciting

wind caught their bows. Corpus pulled away though and the race was back on. We gradually settled into our rhythm and got the first whistle before first post. The crew responded well and the second whistle came going into first post corner. The line was good and the push for ten out of the corner caught corpus by surprise. We bumped them on grassy - even

		<report>A strong start saw queens' W2 gaining on homerton immediately, taking half a length off by the motorway bridge. Homerton were also closing on wolfson and the worry was that they would bump out before the distance could be narrowed further. Queens' kept closing though, and by first post corner, were within 1/4 of a length. At this point, however, St Edmunds (chasing us), though initially nowhere to be seen, literally came out of nowhere with an amazing burst that unfortunately forced us
to concede before we could bump Homerton. This was a very unusual race, as all the boats were so close to bumping, and was a much better row
than tuesday's by queens'. We'll be looking for revenge tomorrow!</report>

		<report>The 1st men's row-over was made particularly painful by the fact that yet again it was a falling christ's boat denying us blades. A strong start saw us move up a little on the Selwyn crew ahead of us, though the choppy water underneath the motorway bridge threw the balance off and meant we struggled to find the
perfect rhythm we had generated in our practice starts. The race plan was to hammer it off the start and wear Selwyn down bit by bit, but it soon became clear that time was running out as they began to get whistles on christ's. The planned push out of first post corner was a little weak, and selwyn had done
enough - christ's succumbed coming round grassy. Frustratingly, selwyn did a
very poor job of clearing and forced us out wide on grassy. As they swung out
into the middle of the river we were pushed over to the outside of the bend and
only just made it round without hitting the bank. The restart wasn't quite as
together as it should have been, but with Robinson only 4 lengths ahead, the
overbump was at this stage still a distinct possibility. A massive push out of
ditton corner saw us move away from the clare crew behind us, but as the
railway bridge approached it became clear that robinson were too far away -
they were themselves closing in on a bump on catz and so had the incentive to
step it up a gear. We finished comfortably clear of clare but sadly our quest
for blades is now over. Tomorrow we will ensure our revenge on christ's is
quick and sweet.</report>

		<report>The 1st women, fell to the size and strength of an
experienced pembroke crew who bumped them just past first post corner. On a
positive note, it was their best row to date, but they just weren't quick
enough to hold off a crew following in girton's wake up the bumps charts. If
they can just hold on and keep 1st &amp; 3rd off their tail tomorrow to
achieve a row-over then they will be able to go to bumps dinner with a smile on
their faces.</report>

		<result>bumped jesus II</result>
		<report>Station 11 was our home for today. The division was late and they were in a rush to get us moving. When the gun went our start was a little rocky and we nearly hit the bank but bow side did their job and we were on course again. We gained on jesus II off the start but they pulled it back again. Neck and neck under the motorway bridge. As we started to claw it back the jesus number 7 man caught a small crab. We picked up on them. Suddenly their 7 man got ejected out of the boat head first. All
the crew were told to hold it up and we were awarded a technical bump.&lt;br&gt;
Everyone was in one piece even if a little bemused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

3 days of rowing and up 3 - bring on FAT II tomorrow.

		<result>rowed over</result>
		<report>Today we expected eddy's to bump homerton quickly, leaving us time to
make the overbump on wolfson. We had our best start yet, and were
gaining on eddy's, who as anticipated bumped out quickly. Unfortunately,
wolfson also managed to bump, leaving us with no-one in sight to chase,
although we still had corpus to hold off, Coming up through plough
reach, we could see that most crews had already bumped and were pulled
over, although we were actually gaining ground on boats at the other end
of the reach from the top of the division, until they too pulled over.
In the end, queens' had an excellent row-over, displaying some of our
best rowing of this term. Corpus were held off, with over 3 lengths of
clear water between us and them by our finish at the railway bridge.
With corpus chasing us again tomorrow, we're in line tomorrow for the
bump on homerton we were denied on thursday.</report>

		<result>bumped christ's</result>
		<report>We had one of the best ever practise starts outside the plough. Loads of spectators had turned up. Our actual start was mildly unbalanced to start with but with a big wind and big high ten push we settled into a powerful rhythm down first post reach. By first post corner we got our first whistle and christ's were weakening. Pushing up through the gut we got onto half a boat length down and finally got overlap around grassy. Pushing down plough reach dom called a bumps 10. The whole boat totally responded (not wanting a repeat of day two where we had three bumps 10s!) and although it wasn't as in time as it could have been the power was huge. Christ's managed to hold on though, and just after our high ten a shrimp was caught. We recovered quickly and convincingly brought the boat right back up to speed and smashed into the side of christ's on ditton corner. Such a good last day of bumps.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p style="FLOAT:right"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After they'd ruined our chances of blades, there was no way Christ's I were
going to receive any mercy from the 1st VIII. We knew we were comfortably
quicker than Clare I behind us, and had no worries about Christ's catching
Selwyn. We could relax and row our own race, confident that with a good
piece of exhibition rowing we would make the bump in style.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

And that's how it panned out. One of the main targets of the race was to
find a good rhythm after the start, and for the first time this week we hit
it straight away. The choppy water on first post reach caused us few
problems, and we had a whistle on christ's before the corner. A good push
out of the corner took us up to two whistles, and a nice tight grassy saw us
right up on their stern. A bumps ten gave us a few feet of overlap on plough
reach, but their cox swerved left to avoid actual contact. Short term this
allowed them to hold us off a little longer, but now out of their puddles,
relaxing into a comfortable rhythm, and with a good line, we knew it was
just a matter of time. The angles worked out perfectly; a second bumps ten
coming into ditton corner gave them only two choices: steer into the bank or
get bumped. Sensibly, they chose the latter.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All in all it was a good and satisfying bump which saw us produce the best
rowing of the week. We were all a little disappointed not to have been
given the opportunity of winning blades, but as the highest placed boat in
the 1st division to go up 3 we can rightly feel very proud of our efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With a number of returning university rowers next term, the mays look set to
be a very exciting prospect.

		<report>An exciting last race for the 3rd Men. After another good start hughes hall
were within half a length, the stride was hit and then a bumps ten called.
A long bumps ten ensued and hughes hall were finally bumped just after 1st
post corner. We had our blades. The carnage followed after we pulled
in - wolfson closely pursued by churchill came charging round the corner
taking a very close line, churchill bumped wolfson who came straight for our
stationary boat on the bank. With a large crash, some ducking and our 6
man leeping to shore for safety everyone was uninjured but our stroke
rigger was bent and stroke blade snapped. As we were sandwich boat for the
next devision emergency repairs were carried out at the p &amp; e before our
next race. &lt;br&gt;The race as sandwich boat was eventful to say the least, involving rowing over the cox of sidney II (she was okay!), but nevertheless unsuccessful as we
were repeatedly held up by carnage ahead of us and eventually given a
technical row over.</report>

		<result>race cancelled due to dangerous conditions</result>
		<report>Everything was running so smoothly.  We had successfully managed to replace a broken bolt that was holding the boat together, and had got onto the water within half an hour of the mott plan.  Gareth had charged us with the target of doing in one outing what QCBC takes six weeks over, so the crew was well focussed.  After a little bit of half slide square blades against the might of the oxford blue boat rating 36, we entered the reach between hammersmith bridge and chiswick eyot.  Suddenly conditions worsened quite a lot, and there was a foot or two of swell, and we could see that conditions were worse further towards barnes.  So we spun and came home.  On the way back we did manage to get some nice work done, managing finally to move together as we wound the rating up, with a nice piece going past barn elms that did feel very sustainable yet powerful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We retired to the lounge of LRC where like the old men we are we all fell asleep while watching the rugby.  We then had a good crew talk before coming out onto the embankment and seeing the lovely tideway that was awaiting us.  The wind was blowing hard and the swell just between the line of moored boats and the bank was a good few inches - heaven knows what it was like along dorney reach.  Strangely noone seemed to have boated.  Then the announcement was made that the race had been cancelled.  There was great disappointment that we'd gone to all the effort of being here, but to be honest it was the correct thing to do.  We just thought of how bad it must be for the hungarians.  Later we heard that three boats had been swamped and a launch had sank round hammersmith bridge.

first half lost us a lot of time, having to start from  almost stopped
both times.  Having restarted along the reach churchill had caught up
to about two lengths.  This had closed to a length by the railway
bridge, where we pushed off again to two lengths, with churchill
closing a bit again by the finish.  A good tussle with a crew in the

		<report>Tired from the first race, and keen to pace this one better, the first
half was rate-capped at 26.  The crew then pushed this up to 30 along
the reach with caius gaining from behind.  caius had closed to 2
lengths by the railway bridge, but queens' wasn't going to let them
past, and sure enough we finished a bit more than a length clear.
Another good tussle with one of the fastest women's crews on the river,
showing that our women respond well to boats around them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately both times were slow showing us that we have a long way
to go.  However, there were reasons for this, and our inexperienced
crew gained a lot of race experience, learning to pace themselves for
the full course.  caius was the only other women's crew racing twice.
Playing with the other crews was excellent and the girls should be
pleased with themselves for a hard day's racing!  There is much to work
on before bumps but they have come a long way since last term.....

		<report>With a strong stream the marshalling area upstream of chesterton was carnage, and we ended up starting off about 4th instead of head. In previous outings this week we'd done plenty of nice rowing at a rating of low 30s, but in the first race little of that relaxed rowing translated across to our race performance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After a ten minute wait down by the lock we set off back upstream. This time the rowing felt far more together and aggressive, and the rating (31-32) felt like it was far more stable. Dom made good technical calls and the boat really responded to them; picking up the boat and making it feel lighter; which let people do more work. A new race start settled us into a nice rhythm for the reach. Under the railway bridge we picked up the rating with pushes for the finish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Overall the 2nd race was better, and it's been a useful (but disappointing) day with plenty to work on for Bedford. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p class=pname&gt;Nick Barsley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Having not warmed up properly the rating felt rushed as we wound up to
30 and settled there.  Not a lot of power in the water and the crew was
not together on the recovery resulting in a scappy first leg.  We were
unable to work properly together, meaning the boat was slow with little
cover.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We decided to go for a bigger wind and settle on the second
leg, and changed the emphasis of the technical calls for the second
leg.  A controlled wind to 35 saw us settle onto a race rating of 32
with a nicer ratio, and better applied power.  People got bored in the
gut and switched off, but the boat felt OK coming round Ditton onto the
reach at 31.5.  Another wind and settle found us a more relaxed rhythm
and we lengthened out with some good technical calls.  A wind for the
finish from the railway bridge saw the rating taken up on the recovery
and everyone shortened up, reversing the good work done on the reach.
Two subs isn't an excuse for the disappointing time, although with some
crucial work to come on power profile and togetherness we can expect
big improvements in boat speed over the next three weeks.

		<report>The 1st women were bumped, but showed remarkable fight in the process. Chasing
magdalene (probably the quickest women's boat on the cam) and being chased by
darwin (one of the top 4 or 5), they were sandwiched in by CUWBC rowers. Yet
their sharp start pulled them well clear of darwin, and they had a really gutsy
row to keep themselves clear right up until the long reach where the sheer
power and experience in the darwin boat showed through. Despite the bump, they
felt genuinely pleased with themselves for the quality of their own rowing in
the face of such fierce opposition, so full credit to them.

Up until this point the rowing had been pretty good but the increasingly rough+choppy water, the corner and then red-liner calls saw the technique and blade work go off.

We started from just behind the railway bridge in the odd position of
having a queens boat chasing us off the start line. When the gun went we
started chasing lmbc VI who were all dressed as school girls.......how
hard could it be? Sadly the crew they were chasing were falling fast.
lmbc bumped out leaving Adele the dubious task of finding enough space
for us to row through the two clearing crews. She managed it with flying
colours, but she did forget one thing, the stride. By now we were all
feeling a little tired plodding along at 38!! We eventually settled into
a rhythm and set about catching wolfson III for the over bump. Every
stroke we took we were getting closer and we finally got within half a
length on the entry into ditton. The over bump then came shortly after
we pushed out of the corner, much to the crews delight.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
None of us had expected to row that far, two members of the crew were
feeling distinctly under the weather and one was already half a bottle
of champagne down after having finished his finals - true

our practise starts left a lot to be desired, but we realised that this would not be an important factor - we would have plenty of time to sort it all out and row them down.  fortunately we didn't need so to do.  the bump happened just after the railway bridge, after less than a minute of rowing.  our clearing left plenty to be desired - managed to ram the sargeant into the bank in only its second outing since a rather more spectacular accident.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

we have the tougher prospect of a hughes hall boat in front tomorrow, which has managed to triple overbump, going up seven places, today.  with an outing under our belts today though, we should be able to give them a run for their money.

		<result>bumped fat</result>
		<report>After a comprehensive bump on emma
yesterday, we knew we had nothing to worry about from behind. If anything was
going to happen in front, it would be lmbc catching robinson, not fat catching
lmbc. The race was quite simply between queens' and fat. Our start was pretty
average - Paul's pushing out failed for once to meet his perfect standard, and
I had to call stern pair to back it down to avoid having the bung forced out of
my hand. That said, we recovered well and were reasonably straight at the
start. fat went off well and, although we moved up in strokes 1-10, they pulled
back onto station in strokes 11-20. We then held them up first post reach,
burying emma in our wake.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We held a good line around first post corner, but the most decisive moment of
the race was coming into and out of grassy. A magnificent push out of grassy
gave us our first whistle, which we held until ditton. Again, our cornering
helped us here. The fat cox went very wide, which I used to our advantage,
hugging the towpath side of the bank and stealing a quarter of a length. Our
planned push out of ditton took another quarter of a length, and before we knew
it we were only half a length down.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I then made the decision to steer out wide, away from fat's puddles. Whilst
this cost us a few metres in the short term, it gave us nice clean water to
chase them with, and paid off superbly in the long run. We moved on right up to
them, and by the railway bridge were bouncing around in their wake. Their cox
called a final last gasp push off the railway bridge, but we were ready. I
waited until their push was nearly over before calling ours, and then we
pounced. 200 metres past the bridge it was all over.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This was one of the hardest bumps we have made in recent years, and to have
made it against such a strong crew made it all the sweeter. Tomorrow we chase
lmbc, who are even quicker than fat, but confidence is high and we're rowing
well. Only time will tell.
&lt;p class=pname&gt;Dom Mott&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
A poor start saw FaT move away from to begin with. By the gut we'd closed to a length, and a big push out of grassy saw us close on them again. We found a good rhythm down plough reach and ate into the distance some more. A good corner by Dom around Grassy saw us capitalise on a poor corner by FaT and we made more ground on them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once on the reach Dom found us some clear water to row in which really helped and we closed the gap some by the railway bridge. We dug deep and carried on rowing, had overlap for a while and eventually made the bump. Sweeeeeeet.

The pairs of crews behind us and in front of King's also bumped out, leaving us to endure a gruelling row over, with a distant Tit Hall behind, and an even more distant CCAT in front. 

Tomorrow should provide us with the opportunity to send the woeful Jesus II on their way to spoons.</report>

		<report>not a great row.  hughes hall had pulled out a length by first post corner, whilst they were also about to bump lmbc IV.  at this time we were looking for the overbump on christ's III, though this was in doubt since lmbc IV were also about to bump them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;
But carnage ensued in the gut - we were told to stop rowing.  lmbc IV were given the technical bump, so we are chasing hughes hall again tomorrow.  it's a tougher challenge, but in general today's rowing improved upon yesterday's, so we may be up to the challenge tomorrow.  and if not, we have got the entire course to grind down lmbc IV!&lt;p class=pname&gt;Christian D'Cruz&lt;/p&gt;</report>

		<report>We'd agreed that, since we knew wolfson III are faster over a longer distance, if we had a chance of bumping it would come from the start. This was put into practice well and we closed the gap to half a length fairly quickly. They however responded and consistently maintained at least a quarter of a length all the way to grassy. A nice touch of coxing from Melvin meant that we had overlap entering plough reach and we rowed back happy to be no longer the foot of the river.&lt;p class=pname&gt;Hugh Earp&lt;/p&gt;</report>

		<report>Jesus II, having denied us blades by rowing so lamentably as to cause the boats ahead to bump out yesterday, were to be punished on the third day of the 2nds Mays campaign.

Churchill II, chasing, could have been a dangerous crew, but were blown out of the water by the devastating Queens' M2 start, and we pushed them away to over 2 lengths of clear water after the motorway bridge, getting the first whistle on Jesus before the stride. We ground Jesus II down slowly over the course of first post reach, gaining overlap at one point, only to be denied the bump by an ill timed crab. We picked up again quickly though, with Jesus finally acknowledging the bump around first post.</report>

This was soon changed as we saw wolfson drop away behind us and the calls from the bank indicated that we were catching homerton. It seemed that we were gaining ground very slowly but there was relief all round as they conceeded upon entering ditton.

		<report>After a term frustrated by injury, the crew had finally begun to string together some very solid outings.  Watching them on the Friday afternoon before Fairbairns, was a great experience.

The first sign that all was not well came when rich huddart at bow felt unwell on Saturday morning.  Andrew Grenfell was called up as a substitute, and the crew produced some fine rowing.

Rich returned on Sunday, but was clearly unwell, and the outing was a disappointment.

Then on Sunday evening, Neil and Andrew both fell ill.

Three of the college's top oarsmen were unavailable through illness, and the crew could not row on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.

On Friday, we decided to try again.  Richard Huddart had failed to recover, so Andrew Grenfell sat at bow.  In the fog, the crew produced two short pieces, winding to 38 and striding to 32-3.  But it soon became apparent that Neil - the powerhouse of the crew - was not well

We scratched the crew, but training in a IV all term has been a valuable experience, and the good coaching we have received should allow us to go into the Lents as a strong force.

		<report>Our plan was to start at rating 32, and then rate cap the race at rating
28. We divided the race up into two minute sections, focussing on different
parts of th stroke. Our first two minutes, working on the finish felt
particularly solid. For the next two, we worked on the catches, and things
felt a little less together.

A good push off the Railway Bridge set us up well for the sprint to the Top
Finish. We lifted out rating, and upped the work. We pushed hard for home,
and crossed the line feeling we'd rowed well.

We were a little disappointed to finish behind one second behind clare, but
still thought we'd had a good start to the year.

		<report>Slight chaos from the division when spinning meant a slightly scrappy start to the race.  The number of crews around us and the inexperience of our cox meant that our line around to barnes bridge was not as good as it could have been.  Still, we started quickly and lengthened out well so that by the time we reached the bridge we were holding a strong, steady rhythm.  We then used the long straight and flat water to reel in the crew in front, overtaking just beyond the bandstand.  We began to tire beyond the chiswick eyot, with the boat feeling quite heavy, but a restart lifted the rate back up.  We'd planned a big push under hammersmith, so with the boat running well we lifted the rating and pressure.  This took us most of the way down the straight, and level with another boat.  Rather than letting them get back ahead, we held our intensity and pushed off them.  Past the black bouy, we were being chased by a quick school crew so we raced for the finish, crossing the line about a canvas ahead.  An encouraging start to the year for the girls.</report>

		<report>This was the first real opportunity we had to show what we could do against some quality crews. With Geoff injuring himself at the start of the week, Harry Gibson came into the 2 seat and so we had only had a couple of outings to gel as a crew. Not to fear though - the previous night's pasta eating "competition", organised by vicky, would surely give us the extra fuel when it was required.
After sitting around at the start line for over an hour the race itself got off to a particularly demoralising start, as we were overtaken almost immediately by a school crew and struggled to find the type of rythm we had in training. Despite the boat not being well sat, it felt quite powerful and there was certainly no lack of effort. We had lots of college crews around us and in particular a good trinity boat who we had our eyes on throughout. The loud Queens' support from hammersmith bridge then provided a huge boost when it really started to hurt, and at this point we overtook two crews to set us up for a big push in the last couple of kilometres. Whilst we were less than impressed with the quality of our rowing, our time was very promising and placed us third amongst all cambridge colleges, just 9 seconds behind first and third who were quickest. With about a month to go, things are looking good for fairbairns. Rich H.</report>

		<report>Sadly, with 2 of the crew out of action, we managed only 2 very tiny outings in the week of the race. However, despite this misfortune, and a bit of a dodgy start, the crew quickly recovered to row an excellent race.  

In the first third of the race, the focus was on establishing a good, sustainable rhythm.  Going under Chesterton, we re-started to get our momentum going, and really come into our own in that difficult middle section. This was one of the best starts that we have done, and the boat picked up speed and flew towards the half-way point near the P&amp;E. We took the opportunity to have another push off the railway bridge coming on to the reach.

The pain of the long reach (and it really seems SO much longer mid-race!) was overcome with the discovery that, despite having been given an extra 30 seconds on us, we had caught up a good 10 boat-lengths on the boat in front, and were gradually closing in on them. Despite some malicious coxing on their part (refusing to move to one side to allow us to come by on the inside of the corner), we did a tremendous last 50 strokes, amid massive excitement and screams from the bank, to inch our bow ball over the finish line miliseconds before theirs!

Everyone in the boat really came together as a crew, and felt that all of the term's training really came into force. We had aimed to be within the top 5 colleges rowing in Fairbairns, and achieved it, being the 4th fastest college (those sneaky Cantabrigians pushed us down to 5th place!) Everyone came out of it thoroughly proud and beaming through exhillaration! Thanks must go to those who came along to cheer - we had some fantastic support towards the end!</report>

		<report>After having a few ups and downs in training, along with a few classic comedy moments, the fairbairns VIII really pulled themselves together over the days leading up to the big race. We'd had good, consistent coaching all through the term and many people in the boat had made big improvements to their technique. All that remained for race day was to keep it all together and give it all the strength we had. We held a consistent, powerful rhythm throughout most of the course, spurred on by our able rivals behind us in the scratch VIII. But not even we, ourselves, were prepared for the power we layed down on the final straight of the course. The bows lifted and an electricity of adrenaline enfused us as we finished off the term's hard work in style - something that clearly reinforced belief of our potential for the future.</report>

		<report>With the crew’s one outing having been curtailed by morning fog, the 
scratch 2nd VIII faced a baptism of fire on race day. However, in our 
favour we had several experienced rowers, 3 – 4 of whom had trained in a 
four during the term, and the stability of the Rob Jeffrey, so it was with 
the optimistic aim of bumping the 1st VIII racing ahead of us that we 
approached the start line. After an unrehearsed and yet powerful start we 
settled into a steady rhythm that was held for most of the course. The 
strength and determination of the crew showed through the lack of training 
as we held the 1st VIII up to chesterton Bridge, but as fatigue set in the 
gap started to grow. Though slightly disappointed at not having challenged 
our rivals more, the time was representative of the nature of the boat, and 
everyone was glad to have taken part.</report>

		<report>The Third men had a very successful day. We rowed over at the top of the fourth division and then bumped Sidney II at the bottom of the third. Special mention should go to Pete Snow, Simon Scannell, Ollie Harding and Dave Johnson who all received their virgin bump today. Hughes Hall who were chasing us in the fourth division took some ground off us at the start but we then steadily pulled away from them on the reach. Sidney were bumped quickly, just after the motorway bridge. Some parts of today's races were a little panicked but this will be ironed out when we relax and get more used to the bumps course. The third men shows good promise for the rest of the week.</report>

		<report>We were not looking forward to rowing over at the top of the 3rd division, but it went surprisingly well. After a tidy start, Corpus I weren't posing any particular threat, and were bumped out by Cauis II quite quickly, leaving us in peace to row the longest piece we have done this term (dont tell Kenelm!). We just got better &amp; better as we came onto the reach, and finished feeling confident for the race to come. Chasing Cats II wasnt going to be all that easy, as they showed us by bumping Homerton II very quickly. We settled into a really good rhythm, and paced ourselves for another rowover, until Taz informed us that New Hall II were rowing like a spider &amp; we were gaining on them swiftly. We caught a length on them, before having to easy due to carnage up ahead, NO FAIR!!!!!!!! We were ready to go for an overbump and some muppets on the gut decided to hold up the whole division, giving us &amp; New Hall II technical rowovers. We would have caught them if it was the last thing we did! Bring on tomorrow!</report>

		<result>rowed over</result>
		<report>After a superb push-out by Paul, in a roaring tailwind, we pulled away from Christ's on the start, and gained a little on Selwyn, who were rapidly gaining on Robinson.  We pushed hard through the Gut, but the crews ahead bumped out around Grassy.  Selwyn failed to clear, and we had to hold it up to avoid ploughing into them.
 
Ian called a restart, and we began to chase St Catherine's 4-5 lengths ahead.  The gap narrowed slowly at first, but as we came onto the Reach, our superior fitness started to show, and we began to reel them in.  By the Bottom finish we had three whistles, and we overbumped about 15 strokes later.  Sadly, the rules mean that this overbump doesn't count (although it would have done if we'd started immediately behind Cats).  Nevertheless, it was an awesome row, and we're confident going into tomorrow, chasing Robinson, and chased by Cats.

Having bumped Sidney the day before we were confident there was no threat from them. We had a great start and settled into our stride really nicely. Girton were taken just after the motorway bridge. Special mention should go to Cat Turner for some very good coxing in difficult conditions. A very satisfying result. </report>

		<report>We had a tough draw with selwyn behind us and fats in front.  Fortunately our start training paid off and we were swiftly gaining on fats.  fats responded and bumped out christ's by first post corner.  So it was up to us to row the course.  By this time selwyn were fading and never came within 3 lengths for the rest of the race.  By the time we headed into plough reach we found that girton was still in the race and so we made the call to try for the double overbump.  In what seemed to be a continuous push for the finish we pulled out the lead on selwyn, but couldn't make up the 3 boat lengths to girton.  It was a great effort from the crew who showed the cam what queens' girls are made of.  Roll on tomorrow.</report>

		<report>Ah well, its was never going to be easy, Caius II showed everyone what they were made of today. We gave them the best race we could; the windy conditions made the start &amp; corners a little wobbly, but we pushed all we could to get away! They finally got us on plough reach, and very nearly snapped one of our blades in half! Hopefully Caius will send Homerton I our way on Friday, after chasing them far too many times last year, I think we have the edge this year, and will be going for our first spectacular bump!

		<report>Due to an airstroke I called a restart; the crew behind starting at the same time and the crew ahead long gone. The boat rocketed forwards, the start becoming a blur. Coming into the gut we saw that crew ahead and those behind falling away fast. A push for 10 out of the gut lead us onto Plough Reach every catching that crew in front. As we came onto the Reach we saw both crews ahead coming closer, finishing within 2 lengths of each and a fantastic time on 7:58. A shame we didn't get on!</report>

		<report>We knew we stood a good chance of getting Robinson after yesterday's performance and rowed confidently from the start. We were preparing to make the bump with a push out of first post but some terrible Selwyn coxing following their bump meant that the river was carnage and the lower half of the M1 division had to be re-rowed. Robinson attempted to claim a techinical row over, knowing there was no escape. But the inevitable happened at the bottom of the reach and we look forward to taking care of unfinished business with Catz tomorrow! </report>

		<report>After having victory so brutally torn away from us on tuesday, we were ready to dispel the bitter taste and row like we knew we could. From the push off, we were forced to recover quickly as a ferocious tail wind swept us up against the bank of the river, but a few seconds lost here were nothing we couldn't deal with. It soon became clear, we were essentially untouchable to the jesus II crew behind us as our greater technique and fitness allowed us to pull inevitably away from them and on towards the potential overbump on downing II. Impressive progress was made on the boats in front, gaining length after length as our aerobic strength showed through. In the end, Downing II bumped out in front of us but we rowed it on regardless to finish in style. All in all a strong and valiant performance, winning back our pride ready for the rematch tomorrow against trinity II.</report>

		<report>Having seen first and thirds bump christ's easily yesterday (albeit due to a crab in the christ's boat), we went out confidently today...perhaps too confidently!  Our plan was to make a move on them in the first two minutes, aiming to bump christ's before grassy. Our start was firm and strong and again we moved off from selwyn, taking them out the race.  However, christ's proved stronger than we had anticipated, and while we came within three quarters of a length of them early on in the race, they made some effective bursts and pulled away from us a bit.  By the time we reached ditton, crew morale was dropping, tiredness was setting in and we accepted it would probably be another row-over.  Another solid row, but unfortunately still not the bump we were hoping for.</report>

		<report>Having unofficially overbumped catz on the first day, we knew that chasing this very inexperienced boat would not present too much of a challenge. After a slightly wobbly start, we settled to a powerful race pace, with robinson on station behind. Up to first post, catz seemed to hold us fairly steady, but having chosen the 'fly and die' school of racing, were blowing by first post corner, and capitulated rapidly; we took about three quarters of a length off them in what seemed like 20 strokes, and bumped them in the gut.</report>

		<report>We knew it would be a tough race today - trinity II are a worthy opponent. Yet we went out strong and edged up on them from the start. It wasn't long before we were on one whistle then gradually two and then three by first post corner, now we just needed to apply the last of all the power we had and finish it off. But amidst the frenzy of a bumps ten, disaster struck as we caught a slight crab possibly only moments before the bump. But still we kept going, after presumably losing much of what we'd earned and giving what felt like everything we'd got, we still kept going. It was a close, long and painful race. You could tell the excitement of it as the spectators ran down the banks of the reach to follow. Finally after completing nearly the entire length of the course we took our very last chance to earn the bump - somehow we found the extra power we needed and dug deep in a final, agonising bumps ten that took us home to the glory we had long been seeking and had long deserved.

Tragically, we were informed a few minutes later that we wouldn't be receiving the official recognition of our achievement, since wolfson had pulled over with a faulty rudder earlier in the course, and trinity II had therefore bumped them. 'That's bumps' is the phrase usually used in this situation - a lesson well learned this term in our boat. Still, it didn't take away from us the glory of such a magnificent race and the feeling of achievement you get from giving it everything you have, and ending victorious. </report>

		<result>bumped first and third IV</result>
		<report>After a successful start to the bumps we knew it was important to keep focused today. We didn’t know much about fat IV, but with little threat from girton II behind we were confident that the bump was there for the taking.  The main concern was, with a hole in our bow and water coming in, would we be able to get them before the boat sank? Only time would tell. 

After a powerful, if slightly rushed start fat were holding us, but we soon settled down into a really strong, relaxed rhythm and began to gain on them. Our first whistle came under the motorway bridge, and a really good legs 10 call from Cat saw us quickly move up to three whistles. With mere inches to go they really put on a push and were able to pull away a few feet, but were only delaying the inevitable. A bumps 10 was called and M3 had their third bump just before first post corner. Tomorrow sees us chasing downing III for the chance of blades. Bring it on!!!</report>

		<report>The morning started with a broken rigger during our morning paddle and an email from Angela who, having soldiered through the first two days with flu, really wasn't well enough to row.  Thankfully, Helen Wheeler came out of retirement and donned her lycra, stepping in at 3.  Today, although we went out physically and mentally exhausted from our two row-overs, we had a strong, fast start that saw us gaining on christ's.  Calls from the bank indicated that we were inching forward, as we pushed off the motorway bridge.  We were half a length off them when unluckily, we caught a crab, allowing christ's to pull away and selwyn to gain a bit on us.  We did a restart and the race was back on...selwyn were still a length off, even though we had had to stop.  We held selwyn all the way to ditton, where another crab allowed them to bump us.  Christ's will have to wait till next year, but we're all hungry for a bump on selwyn tomorrow!</report>

		<result>bumped homerton I, rowed over</result>
		<report>We knew today was our big chance, and we went out there optimistic that we could get our first bump. 2nd in the division, it was a matter of catching Homerton I before Pembroke II had a chance to go for us. Our start was good, but Pembroke had a whistle on us going into first post corner, we knew we needed to get moving on Homerton! We stepped it up a gear, and it was no time before we had a whistle on Homerton, followed by two then three in no time at all! They knew they didnt stand a chance, and we took them down in a matter or seconds going round grassy corner. Huge well dont to Taz, the great line around grassy took us from one whistle to overlap! For many of us it was our virgin bump, and we were so proud to bring home some greenery for the girls!
We were back as sandwich boat, what fun, so we then had to chase the mighty Caius II, keen to make their way up the 2nd division, not an easy task. Our start was speedy, but Caius pulled away pretty efficiently, and bumped New Hall II quite quickly. The overbump was out of sight, so we settled for a strong rowover, and really enjoyed it. 
Bring on tomorrow, we are gonna get the 2nd boat safely in the 2nd division if its the last thing we do! </report>

		<report>We had the full course, from our starting post at the Little Bridge, all 
the way to Chesterton Footbridge to grind Selwyn down. Our starts were 
even, and we were on station until Grassy where we called our big push, 
closing to a length by the Plough. We pushed again out of Ditton, and took 
it down to half a length. Selwyn pushed back, and the gap remained between 
1/2 and 3/4 of a length to the Railway Bridge, where Selwyn started to 
fade. We had the gap down to less than 1/4 of a length by Chesterton.

A decent row to end a reasonably successful bumps for the First Men. After 
a few days' break, we will start preparing for the Eights Head (our chance 
to beat Boar's Head!). Unlike last year, I am determined that we will use 
the period between now and the Mays to build on our fitness.</report>

		<report>Fate has dealt queens' 2nd VIII a tough hand this term. The first day hit us hard since its outcome meant everything - all our hopes rested on something that would be too close to call. It was glorious win or devastating defeat, and we lost out. But over the next couple of races we came to learn that there is more glory to bumps than in winning blades, or even bumping up. We felt that glory when we caught trinity II after the railway bridge, 20 strokes from the finish, and when we rowed today we did it with that feeling in our minds. So when all the boats in front of us and behind us had bumped out, and even the double overbump wasn't on, we didn't ease off the pressure, we rowed strong and proud all the way to the finish - a fitting end for such a powerful and spirited, but tragically unlucky, 2nd VIII crew in a very hard fought bumps campaign.</report>

		<result>rowed over and then bumped new hall II</result>
		<report>Having fought our way back to sandwich boat, we knew we had what was needed to make our way into the 2nd division to stay. We pulled off another strong row over at the top of the 3rd division (we have had quite a bit of practice at this now!) and went into the 2nd race of the day feeling that seeing as we had nothing to lose, we had better get the bump we knew we deserved from Tuesday, as we were once again chasing New Hall II. We knew that we had the stamina to catch them, they had not yet rowed further than the plough, whereas we had notched up quite a distance over the last few days. Our start was strong, and we settled into a controlled pace, pushing for that whistle. They obviously werent going to give up easily, and pushed hard to keep the 90 feet, but we crept up on them inch by inch by inch, finally getting our first whistle after ditton corner. As soon as we heard that whistle, we stepped it up a gear, and steadily ate into the distance between us. We knew the reach was our last chance to secure that place in the 2nd division, and we weren't going to let New Hall get away! After catching a crab at the railings, we recovered really quickly, then came two whistles then three, they new it was all over. It was clear they were far more tired than we were, they caught a giant crab and we bumped before they had a chance to compose themselves. It was a well earned bump, catching them only metres from the finish line! 
We would like to thank everyone who came along to support us, your cheering &amp; shouting made all the difference, and helped us smash through that pain barrier!

		<result>bumped downing III</result>
		<report>Crunch time.  Arriving at the boathouse fired up and slightly frustrated from the ‘romping ban’ imposed by our Cox, there was only one thing on our minds today.  Downing III were standing between us and a what would be a great week of rowing - we desperately wanted that bump! After the slightly controversial ‘lucky pre-bumps warm up’ and energised by Dr Walker’s glucose tablets, we nervously awaited the cannon.  Our start was one of our best yet, and as we hit the stride we were nearly to our first whistle. Some powerful rowing round the first corner saw us close more, and a bumps ten was called under the motorway bridge. After an agonising few moments, our bow slammed into downing III’s stern – we had our blades! The celebrations were postponed for a few worrying minutes as we watched carnage unfold behind us. As downing were between us and the bank, we were unable to clear the river, and rather than steer around us, first and third IV behind decided to head right for us and hold it up at the last minute. Consequently the boats behind us all piled up. Fortunately, the race was not re-rowed after a few crew changes we rowed home in style, covered in greenery,  Many thanks to everyone who put in the hard work that helped make this week so successful, especially Rich Brimfield for his coaching, Cat for some great coxing and Adam for organising all our training. Your efforts did not go unrewarded!</report>

		<result>172nd - 2nd out of cambridge colleges</result>
		<report>Our aim for this race was to focus on rhythm and length.  Things went to 
plan.

Our start was comfortable.  We wound the rating to 31 where it stayed for 
the bulk of the race.  The Royal Navy Crew behind applied a little pressure 
in the first couple of minutes, closing to around a length and a half. 
However, by the time we reached Barnes Bridge, this threat was receding and 
we were starting to eat into the Christ's crew ahead.

Some big pushes on the straight up to Hammersmith enabled us to close the 
gap further, and we had overlap going under the Bridge.  In line with the 
race plan, Ian called for us to work on the power profile in the water, and 
as we entered the final third of the race, we seemed to be flying.  We 
overtook four crews in the final third, in the "graveyard" between 
Hammersmith Bridge and the Finish, where weaker crews traditionally fade.

A great race for Queens'.  Bring on the Mays!</report>

We didn't expect much going into this race, given the considerable experience of our opponents.  Nevertheless, we seemed to have pulled away by first post corner, and were beginning to think that we might actually win!  Then we crashed at Grassy, but we started again.  Then we crashed at Ditton, and got wedged in the bank, and Karthik and Colin came level.  We raced them down the reach - staying about level.

By Grassy, we realised we were going to overtake.  We had a small crash in the Gut, but got it back to overtake round First Post Corner.  Not a bad start!
On the way back, we were chasing Trinity Second Women's VIII.  Again, we gained, and overtook them round the outside of Ditton (hard work!).  Our row down the Reach wasn't so good, and we didn't pull away as much as we'd have liked.

		<result>rowed over</result>
		<report>We were chasing First and Third, looking to for revenge for their bump last year.  However, there were two risks - Robinson, in front of Trinity, were known to be quite slow, while Churchill behind us were probably quite fast.  The threat from Churchill failed to materialise.  We gradually extended our lead.  However, by the Gut we knew that Trinity were closing on their bump, while we were still a length off.  A tremendous push round Grassy and down Plough Reach took us to overlap on Ditton.  As we exited the corner, my blade (at 2) was hitting their stern on every stroke, but Trinity didn't acknowledge for a long time.  When they did, we thought we'd bumped, but the umpire decided Trinity got Robinson first.  Probably not a fair decision, but Bumps isn't a fair race.
 
The good news is that we know we are significantly faster than the two boats in front, and the boat behind.

We got king's down to under a length before they pushed away to get the bump on the weaker emma II boat in front of them. Unfortunately, they didn't clear forcing us wide around grassy, missing a few strokes as our blades collided with the wall. Vaughan skilfully manoevered us back on track as we did a restart to hold girton at half a length (having lost a length in the collision). Girton's whistles were blowing furiously as we held them along plough reach. A heroic restart push prevented them bumping us around ditton, but we were broken by the top of the long reach - being bumped shortly afterwards. We had some bad luck but gave it everything we had and held our composure throughout - it was a row to be proud of.</report>

Chasing girton, we caught up at least half a length on them before they managed to reel in emma II, and then gained impressive ground on the boats in front of them before they bumped out. Each time having to manoevre round the held up boats, losing water to jesus II behind us as we were forced to take a worse line. We held the jesus boat well at just under a length all the way to ditton. It was when we turned the corner though, that the ferocious head-wind hit us hard - we started to lose ground on jesus almost immediately - and for the first time it wasn't because of the line we took. The wind stole away our boat speed and began to rattle our technique. Despite striving with every last ounce of energy we had, there was nothing we could do to prevent the invitable as jesus II held their composure and accelerated towards us for the bump half way down the reach.</report>

Liz called us through an excellent start; our best of the week. Shortly before first post corner, cauis bumped sidney behind and we pushed for 10, spurred on by the crowds. Our line through first post was perfect and we pushed again for 10; we were now rowing at our very best, everyone of us felt it. We were given a whistle out of the corner and sensed victory. We motored forward; now only a quarter of a length from lmbc infront as liz began to call the pressure change into grassy. Carnage lay ahead, knowing they were beaten lmbc half-heartedely avoided the pile up infront and we ploughed into them. The celebrations were quikly ended as, sensing the bump we turned as a crew to relaise that we would be 'technically' rowing over that day. Robbed...that's all there is to say!</report>

We had a cracking start - certainly one of our strongest ever -and flew into the race – never settling below 36!  Kings closed on us vaguely, but shortly afterwards, we gained up to one whistle on Darwin, with 2, 3 then a continuous one in quick succession, and they were ours within 2 minutes.  We caught them on grassy opposite a solid group of Queen’s supporters, to the massive excitement and (some may say slightly excessive) celebration of the crew and all around!

Unfortunately this meant another race as sandwich boat and another shot at FaTs.  We were keen to grind them down as had been our strategy on Wednesday.  They went out hard eager to catch Selwyn.  Unfortunately it was a little too hard for us to make up the deficit and we decided to conserve energy and paddle home.  Selwyn caught Cats (to the dismay of FaTs) so we’ll be looking for a scrap in the 1st division tomorrow.

In the following race at the bottom of the 1st Division, we hit it hard, aware that FaTs would probably close on the struggling Catz boat pretty sharpish. Though we gained ground on FaTs, they did indeed catch Catz, and after a couple of minutes burst at the over-bump, we decided to tap it over, to conserve our energy after a hard day's work on a hot hot day.</report>

But we held it together and didnt lose an inch on our start, even though St Catz II were looking tidy. The first third of the race looked strong, but Catz II bumped Churchill II just before Grassy Corner, we were less than a length behind, so had to take a very wiggly line around them both, which slowed us down quite a bit. Girton II took the wider line around the carnage, and this was enough to give them the edge. We were gaining on the overbump, but unfortunately Girton caught us faster.

We had a whistle within what felt like seconds, and were taking distance off Jesus at a rate of knots. Two whistles came, then three, again and again, we could see them in our sights, but they bumped Churchill II just as we were within inches! We had to hold it up to avoid snapping them in half, leaving us stationary in the path of LMBC III who didnt slow down one bit! We did an amazing restart, trying our hardest to hold off LMBC, we pushed and pushed, they had 3 whistles on us, it wasnt looking good! But Rob made some amazing calls, we squeezed them away, inch by inch, by the time we made the reach, we had gained half a length back off them, and we knew the reach was ours! We made a great push off ditton corner, and pulled away to 2 lengths over the reach. They gave in, they couldnt catch us! As we crossed the finish line at the P&amp;E, we felt so proud of what we had achieved, we didnt give in even when it looked like there was nothing we could do.

The crowds were out in force, and we knew that would help tremendously if we had to go for a long race. We knew we had what it took to catch New Hall II, we caught them on the last day of the Lents this year. If we had to chase them all the way to the railway bridge, so be it, but it was a little hot for that! We pulled off the start quickly, a tidy start earned us a whistle withing a few strokes of the stride. Before we knew it, we had two, then three, then continuous, then their cox conceded before we ploughed them into the bank at first post corner! We had done it at last, even sooner than we had hoped to. But it wasnt over there, a pair of boats had already bumped out on the corner, and the pair behind us were about to bump out too, we were stuck between New Hall on the bank and Churchill and Jesus racing towards us full pace! Thanks to some amazingly clear headed coxing from Rob, we managed to pull in (right on top of New Hall!) to avoid holding up the bump behind us and the rest of the division. And all this right in front of the crowds! Id like to say a big well done to the crew, we pulled off some amazing rowing this week, and to Rob for saving our skins more than once! Also, huge thankyous to Helen &amp; Ros, you have made all the difference this term, and also to our supporters on the bank, including Naomi, Ed, and of course Dr Walker, your encouragement made all the difference!</report>

		<report>A harder row today, but one easier to praise rather than account to luck. We were chasing New Hall III, a strong boat, and being chased by a rather annoyed Emma III (who we bumped yesterday - yess!). New Hall had a strong start and pulled away quickly before bumping their target, Christs' II, leaving us to ward off Emma, which wasn't much of a problem as they got bumped by Kings' II. We kept up a good show for the rest of the course, with miles to spare between us and Fitz II behind - an over bump for us seemed very unlikely at this stage as it gradually transpired that most of the crews ahead had already bumped or been bumped, but we kept the power in the water the whole length of the course and everybody felt we had done justice to ourselves.</report>

we were chasing, and pushing off Kings' II, our stroke's seat came off the
rails. However, despite this mishap we kept going, with 7 and 6 doing a great
job leading, and stroke continuing to row, moving up and down the slide minus
her seat. Although King's responded to a kill call and pushed for a legs ten at
the start of the reach, we proved to be the fitter crew in spite of everything
and managed to hold them off for the rest of the course. Nathan as Cox did a
great job of the corners and gave good calls all the way through the race. It
was disappointing not to catch Christ's today, as we definitely had it in us,
but we all felt very proud of an amazing row over that we managed to make

Bother! So yet another row over, but a good one at that, with Nate doing some great coxing, and crowds cheering from the sides. Once again we proved ourselves a strong (and most importantly, happy!) boat. It was disappointing perhaps not always to have luck on our side this Mays, but going up one overall, and not ever getting bumped may be considered quite an achievement, not to mention the times we have enjoyed as a crew this term.</report>

		<report>So we’ll keep this short and sweet… this was not our day!  The result in no way reflects the awesomeness of this crew.  They know they are one of the best novice crews on the Cam and that’s what counts.  Crabs happen and their standard of rowing (crabs aside) should not be overlooked as it’s absolutely brilliant!  I loved every minute coaching this boat and can’t wait to row with some of the crew next term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;SA&lt;/b&gt;</report>

		<report>An honorable start saw the 2nd VIII settle into a good rhythm. The exceptional Queens' 4th Novice VIII were catching up behind and it looked set to be a superb battle down the reach until disaster struck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a crab or two, a slightly wide corner, and a thoroughly unresponsive boat, the corner was missed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a noise I'll never forget the bows scraped down the side of a barge, then the first 4 foot of the bows inpaled a small dinghy moored at the end of the barge. The boat came to a stand-still, boats charged past, and the owner came out to have a chat. Not the race plan per-se, but an honest effort and I was certainly very impressed with the initiative the novices showed responding to the situation.</report>

		<report>A really good race with nothing unexpected happening! The girls started well, settling into a nice, maintainable rhythm after the start. There were some great pushes off corners, and especially off the railway bridge, with this last push being maintained all of the way up the reach to the finish. These, combined with some great coxing from Rob, meant that they finished in 14th place, as the second fastest 2nd boat!! This fantastic result is testament to all the hard work and enthusiasm that they've put into their rowing this term. Well done girls (and Rob!!), I was really proud of you all today.

		<report>Due to a super speedy bunch of novices last year, we found ourselves nestled very high up in the womens 1st division, surrounded by the likes of FaT I, Catz I, Fitz I, but we didnt let this worry us! We pulled off a beautifully timed &amp; tidy start, and looked strong going into the corner, but almost straight away, Kyung's seat came right off the runners &amp; got stuck, where it stayed for the rest of the race! She didnt let this stop her, I have never seen anyone put so much into arms &amp; backs rowing, what a star! So we carried on, we were gaining on the crew ahead! George called a great restart out of both of the big corners , and as we finished the push after chesterton, we looked amazing! We got stronger and stronger as we came onto the reach, with nobody in sight behind us and Fitz I getting nearer &amp; nearer, we gained steady ground. More huge pushes out of the railway bridge and for the finish, and we crossed the line in style, only half a length behind Fitz. 
 
The girls rowed beautifully, they showed just how much they had learnt this term, they put in 100% and didn't let their technique slide even as they crossed the line. George did brilliantly, he was easily the loudest cox on the Cam today! Well done all round 3rd boat!

		<report>Arguably the performance of the term from any Queens' crew. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Going into the race our preparation had been good and with strong performances in Emma and Clare (finalists and semi-finalists in the lower division) we were confident of coming away with a few scalps. &lt;BR&gt;The crew coped well with inhospitable conditions outside the boathouses to produce a powerful but controlled start. The stern pair combined well to quickly settle the crew in to a solid rhythm. With a rating of 31 throughout we had a solid base from which to achieve a good time. &lt;BR&gt;Following our race plan, we kept the focus on good technique until Chesterton. Boosted by a nice line from Louise and pushes out of the bends we began to take ground from the 2nds ahead of us. &lt;BR&gt;At Chesterton a good corner was followed by our big push and saw our speed pick up. The crew really turned on the power heading down towards the P&amp;E and by Peter's Posts had the 2nds down to 2/3rds of a length. Unfortunately disaster then struck, the 2nds entanglement with a tender, denying us what would have been a famous overtaking move. &lt;BR&gt;Crucially the crew remained unphased and were able to finish strongly. This was a brilliant result, the fastest IV VIII on the river by over a minute, beating not only Queens 2 and 3 but also first boats from Darwin, King's, Sidney, Cats, Tit Hall, Churchill, Selwyn and Girton. This was a victory for our technique over the brute strength of our rivals. Coaching this crew was a privilege, they should be very proud of themselves. WELL DONE.IK    </report>

		<report>So…our first race in an actual boat - dressed as pirates with a parrot as cox!!!  The first round posed no problems with a strong start and then settling into a good rhythm, we left lucy cavendish far off on the horizon somewhere, long after we’d crossed the finish line.  Next we were against darwin.  It would not be unreasonable to question if they were not in fact men but their scary size and blacked out faces were no match for us.  It was a more exciting race but we finished three quarters of a length up and smiling.  So then in the semi’s we met jesus.  We had a good start and edged ahead of them, holding it a quarter of a length ahead as we set off down the reach.  We were looking strong until the crab monster struck and we had a (very!) close encounter with the bank.  Sadly a strong restart was not enough to claw our way back, with little more than 100m left of the course.  However, we were not to be disheartened and happily raced pembroke back up the reach for third place.  No problems here and we finished a length and a half ahead; pleased with everything we had achieved and learnt from the day.  Bring on Clare Novices…and Fairbairns!</report>

		<report>The prize for best costume on the day should surely have been awarded to the Queen Bees! Complete with wings and antennae, the girls got lots of comments on the row up, as did our lovely flower cox, Hetti. The girls were racing emma B in the first race, unsurprisingly the marshals gave the emma boat a huge head start! However, this didn't faze them and after a strong start, the Queens' boat was ahead by the middle of the course. Unfortunately at this point, a slight mishap occurred and Queens' ploughed straight into the emma boat at full speed! Luckily no damage was done, and the win was awarded to Emma, but we were happy that we could have beaten them if we hadn't crashed. The next race went a lot smoother, in that the newnham 3 boat was left so far behind that there was no danger of any crashing! Hetti took a line down the middle of the reach and the girls emerged victorious, several lengths in front of the opposition. Well done girls, a fantastic day!</report>

		<result>Lost to jesus in the 1st round</result>
		<report>Dressed at ninjas, the might RUPs (Real Ultimate Power) took an early hit with two absences meaning a last minute reshuffle of crew was called for. With a new stroke they walked to the railway bridge to wait for the boat and had a full 10 strokes of warm-up before the start against jesus. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the circumstances, the performance was not their best with timing issues preventing the crew from demonstrating the power in the boat. The second race against a mixed christs boat was a success. Emma marshals asked the bow man and 2 seat to remove their feet from the shoes on the footplates to even things up, but despite this RUP powered ahead to a convincing victory, showing the promise of the power in the boat. A good first race performance to build upon.</report>

		<report>The first race was against jesus c. It was really speedy but a bit over-enthusiastic off the start. A couple of crabs hampered progress but despite these and the subsequent restarts the girls finished only 2 lengths behind a strong crew.
 
The second race was against the womens’ emma c boat that queens men had just beaten. We took a few minutes to chill after the first race, and decided to take the next one in a more relaxed style, 90% effort start, and see how it goes. The slower rating off the start paid off, they flew away from Emma on the legs 10, and by the stride we had the lead. Emma made a big push, but we followed theirs with a faster one, got from 1/4 length behind to 1/2 length in front over our first legs 10, then just to seal the deal, did another push to increase the gap. Some great calls from George kept the girls going to the line. Victory was had with 2 lengths of turbulent water between the boats. 

Special mention goes to George; our cox, for some fabulous parking.

		<report>Having been disapointed with our result at Queens' Ergs Emma provided the opportunity for us to turn things around. The Sergeant arrived at the P&amp;E complete with a crew of 007'S. The loss of the cocktail shaker under the railway bridge certainly left us shaken not stirred. (Enough of the cheesy puns). We rowed well to reach the final against Jesus III (probably the fastest two crews in the plate contest). In a hard race Jesus III's 'longboat' just had the edge over the Sergeant, which is certainly no Aston Martin. Nevertheless our performance suggests that we have the potential to do well this term.IK </report>

		<report>At the start of term there were high hopes for a strong performance at IV's head. These soon began fade when Ed Adams injured his back. The absence of available replacements and the LBC commitments of two of our crew began to take their toll on our training schedule. A week before the race Ed Adams had recovered sufficiently to rejoin us only for our preparations to be further dogged by a combination of food poisoning and gastric flu. By the time it came to race day our hopes, for what was now effectively a scratch crew, were not high. The race started well with the best rowing we had produced so far. The boat sat up and Richard and Sean were able to grind out a solid rhythm. In the end, however, our lack of preperation caught up with us and we had a real fight on our hands past Barnes. What turned out to be a nice row was ulitmately far too slow and we were shown wanting at the hands of our college rivals and the Boars. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Congratualtions to the Boar - but beware QCBC will back on the Thames in March with a lean, mean, green rowing machine.

We walked through the first round winning our heat easily and securing our place in the final following some awesome individual performances and some fantastic PB’s.  Following a lot of lucozade, cereal bars haribo (some sleeping…!) and what seemed like hours of TV we returned for the final. Again, everyone gave their absolute all and I was so proud of everyone.  Finishing 4th overall to some particularly ‘hefty’ crews was awesome. With 448 female competitors the final individual results were fab!  Particular mention to Zoe Blain who came 14th and who we borrowed from the 2nd boat for the evening! And to Alice Wordley who finished 24th. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;SA&lt;/B&gt;</report>

		<report>First race was against magdelene. They'd made it to the final of queens' ergs, so we knew they'd be tough opposition. After a textbook start the much-altered crew continued pounding away at too high a stroke rate. Nonetheless, we were still well ahead. After a crab on our part they were looking stronger, and  were inching back with every stroke. A crab from their stroke and a few moments of panic saw them veer towards the bank with their bow-side not being able to row. We continued and won comfortably, but for about a minute they could have taken it from us. 

The second (against whom?) saw both crews drift into middle water and we clashed oars. A hell of a crab from stroke (through hitting their blades) saw us get stuck. Having waited for some space we piled on the speed, taking more than two lengths off them , but still losing. Thanks to George and Rob for subbing. </report>

		<report>I knew this was going to be fab before it started!  Yet again crew spirit was running high and the desire to do well for each other coupled with the crews’ awesome ability on the water were bound to be a lethal combination!  In the first round we left Robinson trailing far behind with a very strong start and then a strong rhythm to follow.  Phase 1 complete!  Back to the boat house to watch very old boat race videos and eat a ton of haribo as is mandatory for QCWBC!!  Then back onto the water for phase 2 - Peterhouse.  No worries here… Phase 2 complete with many complementary comments from the umpires!  Another wait and then we meet the ‘home team’, Clare, in the quarter finals.  The crew do their thing again and more awesome rowing sees phase 3 completed.  OK so then it got controversial…Semi – final time and Queens’ drew up alongside Emma on the start line.  Exactly what happened I’m not sure but it went along the lines of the race being started while our fantastic cox Jonno’s arm was still in the air, our not being ready or straight, panic, a crab and a crash.  The umpire stopped the race and after much debate called a restart despite Emma having been ahead at the time.  I was so proud of the girls for refocusing so quickly, getting back into their race and crossing the finish line ¾ of a length up on Emma in what was their first proper battle of the day and truly gutsy performance.  It was unfortunate that there was so much controversy in the race and we are sorry for Emma but with the decision made we had to move on and focus our attentions on Jesus for the final.  This we knew was going to be a battle against a very fit Jesus crew but we also knew we had what it took if everything went to plan.  As the crews took off up the reach it was neck and neck and then Queens’ started to pull ahead.  The umpire went mad with his whistle as Jesus forced us further and further into the bank and I honestly thought they were going to be disqualified but then as we came up to the railway bridge Jesus moved back to their side of the river to take the inside of the bend and Jonno not unreasonably followed.  The umpire then decided to focus the attention of his whistle on us and Jonno was forced to veer the boat sharply back across the river which took off a little boat speed giving Jesus the edge to pull away and finish a length ahead of us.  To win would have been fantastic but I was just as impressed and proud of the result as runners up. The girls really pushed themselves and the standard of their rowing after such a short time is really incredible.  So excited for QCWBC in the coming terms...

		<report>Having learnt a lot from Emma Sprints last week, the girls went into Clare knowing that they were more than capable of doing well. The first race carried on from the easy win last weekend, with the girls leaving FaT B far behind. A really good row - they were strong off the start and maintained the pressure throughout the race, with an excellent strong push off the railway bridge. In the next round they met Jesus B. Both crews were looking forward to a good race between two strong crews, however this wasn't to be as the Queens' crew managed to drift into the bank fairly soon after the start. A real shame, because by the time Queens' had pushed off and done a restart, Jesus had had too much of a head start for us to realistically hope to catch them. However, the girls did manage to close up some of the gap before the railway bridge. It would certainly have been a close race so now we're all really looking forward to taking them on in Fairbairns! With every race this crew is looking better and better so I'm confident they will do really well.

		<report>A free ride through to the second round was always going to be a bonus, but it put us against Magdalene B, who had already beaten another B boat that day. We didnt let this dampen our spirits, as we knew they would be tired and cold already. After a small panic on the row down to the start (the seat came off the runners, there were rumours it was broken, bow pair in fits of giggles trying to fix it!) we put the boat back together and composed ourselves, as we knew we needed to be calm going up to the start line. 
 
We had learnt a lot from Emma sprints, and it showed! The start was tidy and pretty quick, but it didnt gain us any lead against Magdalene, the rumour that they row like a spider was unfounded it would seem! We made some really strong pushes, and scraped a quarter of a length into the lead, but they pushed off us &amp; look that and another length back off us. We made a big push under the railway bridge, and gained back lots of what they took, but it wasn't enough, we finished three quarters of a length down. 
 
A gutsy row from all the girls meant they went home feeling proud of themselves, we did so well to take on a second boat and give them a run for their money! As always, George made all the difference, what a legend!

		<report>The Fairbairns VIII produced some very good rowing during this "longer then expected" Head Race. The 2.6km course saw the girls pitched against Clare, Girton, Pembroke Jesus and Magdalene. 
It seems that the "hamming" of Rob Willicombe, mixed with coaching from Dave White paid off for the first VIII who came in at 3rd place behind Clare and Jesus respectively with a time of 11.32. Of course it would have helped if we knew where the course ended as there were many calls of "push for the last ten" heard from the rather confused Rob.</report>

		<report>Well its been a hard term. With a few guys who could have qualified as novices in the boat (infact Andy Dyson did row as a novice then jumped into our boat the next day at short notice only havng rowed with us once before)we were never going to win fairbairns. We lost men to injury (Don't let Tom Smith near bread knifes in future). Only 6 men rowed with us the whole term by the time it came to the race we were as much a crew as the other more experienced queens' boat. Despite all this i think we were all dissapointed with our result.

We got off to a good start but couldn't hold that form throughout the course. Rowing at seven I found it hard to see what was happening behind me but it felt like there were a couple of small crabs (shrimps) which slowed us down and broke the rythm up. By the time we hit the long reach pembroke 1st were in position to overtake us. We held them off for longer than could have been expected but they eventually passed us and this seemed hit the crew hard. We then faced rowing the last stretch of the race rowing to maintain our honour.

A special mention must go to our cox Hetti who was only a novice this term. We put her through her paces and she faced some tough outings but she came out smiling and a better cox for it all (although she should refrain from the 'lazy cripple' call). A prospect for the future. </report>

		<report>Well... so the end of term has arrived, and amidst the carnage of this term (boat swapping/people swapping/rigger swapping) the first IV have come up with a respectable little finish at Fairbairns '05-'06. The crews that beat us were particularly strong, something we knew already, but coming 6th was not a bad end. Coxed particularly efficiently by Rob Willicombe who did an excellent job on some very hard corners, not to mention keeping us girls from dying! (However no amounbt of good coxing can help the fact that half the boat needed the loo throughout the whole course!)</report>

		<report>There was a lot of upheaval in the women's boat club in the second half of this term, and this combined with illness meant that the 2nd IV only had about four outings together before Fairbairns, and then only one in the boat that we were going to race in. However, we gave it our best, and, perhaps slightly to our surprise(!), had a good clean race that we were all proud of. There were some great rating changes and the final push onto plough reach was great! Thanks to Liz for coaching us, it all came together in the end!</report>

		<result>6/ 42 in a time of 15:26</result>
		<report>The plan was to row to Chesterton at 31, push up to 32 until Ditton, and then 33 to the finish. We didn't cross the line at full speed but settled quickly into a good 32-33. Despite this, it took us a few minutes to warm up and really feel the boat move. Coming through Chesterton we did a big push and the boat really responded well, setting us up for a good row down the reach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The crew dealt well with the headwind, and we pushed out of each corner together. Our cox box died at some point, but the crew knew when the pushes were and we kept on pushing. A solid rating build down first post reach saw us over the finish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all, a reasonably solid race with plenty to be pleased about.NB &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was a reasonable result given our status as a 'scratch' crew. A satisfying end to a term that has been frustrating at times. We'll be back to unleash the power of the boar next term.IK</report>

		<report>A truly uneventful performance, with a lack of crabs or dinghies meant we had a fun row. A higher stroke-rate from the start might have been a good idea, but at the slower rate the timing and technique was awesome. The boat was sat up throughout (except for the first few strokes as we passed the start line, thanks to a loose gate), and the steering was perfect. 

A great row to round off a fun term's rowing. Sad that Colin couldn't make it, but many thanks to Dan for subbing in. </report>

		<report>This was a fantastically gutsy performance by everyone and by the end of the night emotions were running high showing the amazing team spirit this crew has!  We walked through the first round winning our heat easily and securing our place in the final following some awesome individual performances and some fantastic PB’s.  Following a lot of lucozade, cereal bars haribo (some sleeping…!) and what seemed like hours of TV we returned for the final. Again, everyone gave their absolute all and I was so proud of everyone.  Finishing 4th overall to some particularly ‘hefty’ crews was awesome. With 448 female competitors the final individual results were fab!  Particular mention to Zoe Blain who came 14th and who we borrowed from the 2nd boat for the evening! And to Alice Wordley who finished 24th. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<result>16:21: 8th out of the 9 Cambridge Colleges.</result>
		<report>The plan was to rate at about 30 and maintain our technique throughout. Some very powerful practice starts on the way down saw us confident on the start line. We set off and settled into a good rhythm, although were lacking slightly in the confidence we'd had on the row down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were surrounded by crews in the Elite division which gave us plenty of competition to push against. Clare reeled us in over the 5km and managed to pass us about 500m from the finish line. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technique held fairly well, but Clare coped better with the choppy water than we did. The agression and determination from Queens' held until the end and we were at 32 for the majority of the way. All in all it was a good first race for a very newly formed crew. Looking forward to some sweet revenge at Bedford.

With Head Coach Ros Hillard on the bank overseeing the entire (very unimaginative!) race the girls started strong and showed real togetherness. Despite it getting a bit messy about halfway through, a few calls from cox Dom Mott for "10 captain's strokes" made sure we went over the line knowing we couldn't ahve done it any better so early on in term!

After hitting rate 36 off the start, we settled in to solid rhythm which held over the course. The race was completed with some good sprinting. Without the confusion over the start and the inconvinience of having to take the outside arch, because of the womens crew ahead, we may well have gone quicker.

		<report>A terrific day for the crew. We started out against an unknown quantity from France - ESCB. We were very tense off the start and spun our wheels badly at 42 but eventually settled to a comfortable pace which saw us move smoothly past them by several lengths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next round brought us up against Trinity Hall which we knew would be a tough race. We had a few issues with keeping a consistent line, yet coming under the railway bridge Trinity Hall moved over into our water. After several blade clashes and the TH cox recieving a few knocks Tit Hall were clear ahead. TH were disqualified and we went through. It was a shame the clashes had happened as it would've been a terrific race without them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next round was Sidney Sussex. A more relaxed start saw us move up half a length. We hung here until the railway bridge at which point we made a move and burried them. Wound down 5 lengths from the line. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semi-Finals: &lt;/b&gt; Jesus. This crew beat us by over 2 minutes at The Head of the Nene. We went out agressive and fast - as did they. We were level until the railway bridge at which Jesus just started to inch out a lead. A big 20 from us closed the gap and we moved back well. Coming into the last corner we had the inside lane and were gaining fast, yet Jesus just managed to cling on to win by 1/2 a length. A terrific race.</report>

		<report>Another year, another Pembroke Regatta, but this time with a difference for the First Lent VIII Ladies- we had a sneaky Coach and Cox! Up against Kings, we all knew we had our work cut out but hadn't quite remembered exactly how good they were, despite them beating us by 35 seconds at peterborough, and knowing that a lot of them have May colours. None-the-less, we were psychologically (thanks boys) ready to go in with a real chance. the race wasn't the best we've done and could have been cleaner, but we held them for the first half and only finished a length behind them- which just goes to show how much we have all improved. After the revelation that Dave and Dom WERE happy with our performance, we all went back feeling pretty pleased with ourselves!!</report>

We assumed we'd be facing cauis II (since they were taking on christ's II) but cauis scratched. Another good start saw us about equal after the first 15 or so strokes, but christ's simply were faster than us. After they'd caught a crab about a minute in we pulled it back, and hetti's good calling got us ahead by about 1/2 a length. We held them there for the 2nd and 3rd quarters, but they got some speed on, and even giving it our all couldn't get us ahead. 3 feet was the distance - the bow canvas. Couldn't easily have been closer, but the best we've rowed, and a loss to be proud of. Well done to all. GR</report>

What a mess! After a fairly even start, we started to squeeze ahead, so FaT's cox decided to change the format from side-by-side to bumps style! We rowed up the reach clashing blades the whole way, Daisy at bow got taken out a good few times, with only 5 or so of our boat rowing we werent feeling strong! We were being squeezed between them &amp; the bank, and as we came up to the motorway bridge we were hitting stroke side blades on the bank too.  They managed to push through us to win by half a length, but were disqualified for dangerous and completely incompetant coxing. 

Round 2! Newnham II
We knew we could row better than we did in the first round given half a chance, and we showed Newnham what we were made of! Great start, great pushes, we couldnt have rowed better, unfortunately they were just a bit quicker, and won by a length or so. Good race girls!</report>

Unfortunately the Darwin first boat behind were too quick. Being a first boat, and filled with experienced oarsmen the Darwin boat simply out-paced Queens' today and bumped just before first post. A gutsy row from Queens' held them well and never gave up. Bring on FaT later in the week!</report>

		<result>rowed over</result>
		<report>This bumps race had absolutely everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  

The start was a bit interesting with the chain going very taught, but Ian 
held on until the gun and they were off to a fine start and gained about a 
quarter of a length early. Rowing cleanly and in control they had moved to 
within about half a length of Selwyn by first post, but Selwyn were also 
closing on Tit Hall in front of them. The gut was not the best rowing as 
the guys perhaps tried a little too hard and took some of the speed off the 
boat and the margin had slipped out to almost a length by Grassy Corner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The boys stormed down Plough Reach and closed to within a canvas by Ditton, 
but Selwyn were looking like they were going to bump Tit Hall in front of 
them. A massive push around Ditton was called for, and it came but Selwyn 
were chasing a bump and not going to give in easily. In front of them there 
was carnage as Churchill bumped Emma, but all coxes did a great job and the 
race went on unimpeded. Half way down the reach Selwyn had overlap on Tit 
Hall and steered for the bump, missing it by a grand 2 foot. This steering 
error however cost them about half a length and from then on Tit Hall just 
moved away from Selwyn and Selwyn moved away from Queens'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

At this point, just to make things more interesting, Clare began to close 
from being a mile behind to all of a sudden being just half a length behind 
Queens' and closing fast, with Queens' looking a bit like a spent force. 
Perhaps this spurred the boys on a bit and they held Clare and started to 
move rapidly back into Selwyn. As they passed the Pike and Eel, the margin 
was just a canvas and I thought maybe they would make a last gasp bump but 
it was not to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A terrific row by all concerned - congrats to Tit Hall, Selwyn and Clare on 
some fantastic bumps racing, and though the bumps charts will suggest that 
it was a dull row over, it was one of the most amazing bumps races that 
either Paul, Robin or I have ever seen. Tomorrow we have to do it all 
again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<result>rowed over</result>
		<report>With our captain Ellie struck down with a tummy bug the night before the race, and a last minute cancellation of the planned early morning paddle, preparation was not ideal. Thankfully Fiona was able to step in at 6 and the row down turned out to be quite tidy - the start at the Plough was arguably our best yet, and after I got bored of sitting behind Catz W1 having to do single strokes as they hacked down the river, we just rowed past them on our way to the start!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
The start was pretty reasonable but Selwyn's race plan was obviously to go hard and fast off the start to catch Christs before we got them. The gamble worked - they pulled away at first but although we were catching back up as we settled into our rhythm, they made the bump on First Post Reach. Their clearing left a little to be desired but I managed to sneak through on the inside chasing Churchill for the overbump. With calmer water than Churchill, who were hot on Tit Hall's tail, we edged our way towards them but the gap was just too big. Catz behind us had been bumped by New Hall fairly quickly, leaving just Fitz at the back of the division chasing us, but we had made up so much ground that we could safely drop down to light pressure for the final minute up to the Railway Bridge to save our legs for an onslaught on Christ's tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Falling Christ's boats have denied me blades twice now, but all on the 3rd or 4th days. Let's hope it turns out that they denied us today, as we look forward to mowing down the crews in front over the next 3 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<report>Todays row was much less interesting, but ultimately much more successful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The start was clean, but Selwyn had an equally good start and after a 
minute they were level water with the crews in front and behind. Clare 
(behind) had brought along a hooter, a whistle, a brass band and the Berlin 
Philharmonic Orchestra and were making a lot of noise, but most of it was 
unjustified as Queens' did a nice push into first post and closed to about 
three quarters of a length on Selwyn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The gut was clean and the push out of Grassy Corner began to pay dividends 
as they closed to just under half a length coming into Ditton Corner (by 
this stage Clare had parked their boat on the outside of Grassy Corner, 
much to the disappointment of the accompanying musicians).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Out of Ditton Ian took a terrific line and found some clean water in the 
middle of the river while Selwyn went to investigate Stourbridge Common. A 
canvas of overlap turned into almost half a length before the inevitable 
bump came about half way down the reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A clinical performance today. Much less interesting, but generally more 
satisfactory than yesterday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<result>bumped Christs</result>
		<report>With Ellie still not recovered it was musical chairs again today, with Di coming out of rowing retirement and taking a break from her training for the London Marathon by slotting into the 6 seat. The blizzard conditions had abated by the time we pushed off, and the row down was actually rather good, even if the nerves were still showing on the two rather rushed practice starts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
The race plan was straightforward - just settle into a rhythm and reel Christ's in, knowing that we had the whole course to do it. Off the start we perhaps took a metre or two, but were happy just to keep it ticking over. Christ's must have decided to go "all or bust" because they actually moved to within a length of Selwyn (who had bumped them by First Post yesterday) by the Motorway Bridge, but the gamble failed, and they tired quickly. Although we were a little panicked in the choppy water it took very little time to make the bump after we'd got within a length for the first time. Christ's were falling apart but refused to concede until it was blatantly obvious they couldn't get round First Post Corner without saying hello to our stroke side blades, and thus the job was done. Sitting on the stern of Caius W1 all the way home from Chesterton was a nice bonus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Getting the first bump of the week was all well and good, but we weren't particularly happy with that standard of rowing, and we certainly won't settle for cruising home for the last 2 days. If the boats ahead do their job and bump out in line with expectations, we should have the whole course to hunt down Selwyn - but I'm not going to say any more about our tactics in case they read this post!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The crew showed a lot of determination to keep jesus II at a canvas for such a long time. Even when they had overlap we kept pushing them away. Thanks to Neil for subbing in.

		<result>Rowed Over</result>
		<report>Today we were very well prepared for what was ahead of us, all the nerves had turned to excitement and we were raring to go! As the 4 minute gun went off, the sky filled with huge snowflakes, which we decided was a definate good luck sign (as it had snowed on Tuesday), so we were calm and confident waiting for the gun.....

Our start was not bad, we got into a good rhythm and off we went. The pairs in front &amp; behind us bumped out quite quickly, and before we knew it there was nobody left to chase, they were all pulled in and cheering for us like mad! So we wound it down a bit, and rowed on up the reach all by ourselves in peace. Good effort all round! </report>

		<result>rowed over</result>
		<report>This row was less interesting than the previous two days. The start was 
clean though not dynamite, and they settled into some nice rowing down to 
first post, basically holding water with the boats in front and behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A good first post corner pulled in a bit of ground and some solid work down 
the Plough Reach pulled them to less than a length by Ditton. Unfortunately 
it was not to be though as Tit Hall squeezed back out to a length and a 
half with a good push out of Ditton Corner and went on to increase this 
margin by the railway bridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The old adage that fast boats make bumps proved true today. The boys had a 
good technical and tactical row but lacked the basic boat speed to catch 
the boat in front. Tomorrow there is another chance to try to find that 
extra gear - this time there will be more pressure from behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<report>Still no Ellie, and by the looks of things she won't make tomorrow either. Not ideal, but Di has been great so far and has fitted really well into the crew. A big thank you to her for helping us out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
I wasn't entirely happy with the row down, it seemed a bit lacklustre, but it got the job done and we were moving well enough. The starts were a bit scrappy and we over-rated despite instructions to keep it controlled, but again it was probably just the nerves creeping through. And at least this time Pippa didn't get a nosebleed on the 4 minute gun like she did yesterday...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
An ideal line off the start with the chain perfectly taut saw a reasonable first minute or so as we moved up a touch on Selwyn. Their higher rating managed to hold us off up First Post, however, but we were roughly on station coming into Grassy. This was exactly where we wanted to be, and the next minute's rowing was sensational. Katie and Grace levered us round Grassy and the massive push out of the corner was just phenomenal, we took a good half length off Selwyn and came within a length as we rowed up Plough Reach. They just about held on as we came into Ditton, but crews pulled into the bank on the corner after bumping out cancelled out the advantage we usually gain with our tight cornering, and out of Ditton we were still somewhere between a half and three-quarters of a length off. We pushed and pushed but every time we threw something at them they responded, and despite emptying the tank in the last minute they held on to their slender margin to row over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
It was disappointing not to have made the bump after pushing them the whole way, but every single one of us gave it our all. Three of the crew were in tears as we wound down, but there was no shame in the performance. The row home was one of the proudest moments of this term, the concentration was spot on and despite being utterly knackered after such a long hard row, the boat sat up nicely and they pushed through the pain to work the lactate out of the muscles. Tomorrow we have another shot at Selwyn. They must be exhausted too, so we will go out positively hoping to hunt them down to cap off a good week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<report>The best start so far saw us rocket away from churchill II. Yet more good coxing and calling saw us take ground of jesus II. Churchill tok us down to a length through first post corner, and we kept them there through grassy. A good push out of there took us back to a length and a half, and just before we started the turn onto the reach we saw corpus I take out churchill (thanks in part to an almighty crab from their bow). 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Nonetheless we held our composure, and continued to row hard. A good push out of ditton saw us hit the reach for the first time. We responded well to more calls to push, and before a crab 3/4 of the way down the reach we were still going for the bump. Knowing that was no longer to be we paddled home. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The longest row we've had so far and by far the best. Thanks to Doug for subbing in.

		<report>After a very tidy start we were looking good, and we were settling in to eat into Newnham II (who were all set for spoons). However Pembroke were gaining on us too, it was all still to play for as we pulled a great line round first post corner, into absolute carnage. The division was stopped, and as Pembroke II had 2 whistles on us, the umpires decided to give them the technical bump. Not really all that fair, but thats Bumps!</report>

		<report>We started well today, pushing off st edmunds, and were holding them off past the railway bridge. However, a crab and the resulting broken seat knocked a couple of our crew out of the race, and eddies easily caught us. In fairness, they were the faster crew, but we'd hoped to hold them off for longer.

		<result>bumped Trinity Hall</result>
		<report>We bumped Tit Hall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Today's row was a real credit to the guys, but not for the mere fact that 
they bumped Tit Hall. Having rowed over quite a long way behind them 
yesterday they had a choice to either come out resigned or aggressive 
today. They chose to come out aggressive and really chase the bump, knowing 
that there was a Clare crew behind them that was getting faster each day, 
and the risk of chasing the bump too aggressively was to get bumped late in 
the course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The start was terrific with the rate above 40 for the first minute, and 
then staying there as they settled. The rowing was clean but aggressive, 
but Tit Hall and Clare both were rowing equally well and Queens' only 
stayed on station with both crews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

At this point (apparently due to an equipment failure) there was a crab in 
the Tit Hall boat, and this effectively stopped them in their tracks 
handing Queens' the bump a few hundred metres before first post corner. 
This was unfortunate for both Tit Hall and the race itself which promised 
to be a good one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Commiserations to Tit Hall for some bad luck - it is not a good way to get 
bumped and is an unfortunate way to end a bumps campaign. To the Queens' 
crew however, well done on approaching what could have seemed like a dull 
race in the right way. I think up 2 is a good result for the work you put 
in this term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Kris Coventry (from the bank)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Well done to the crew on an excellent effort this term. We worked incredibly hard to turn things around after Peterborough - it paid off. We will now turn our attentions to the Head of the River Race. I am confident of a strong performance on the tideway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<report>A good solid row down to the start in spite of the snow showers, and another inch perfect push-off from Paul meant that, Ellie aside, we gave ourselves the best possible opportunity to hold off New Hall and see if Pembroke would hold Selwyn long enough for us to have a go at them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
We over-rated a touch off the start but it was going quite well. Somewhat optimistic whistling from New Hall behind just didn't trouble us, and although we lost half a length to Selwyn, we knew we just had to row our own race. Things got a bit scarier when New Hall's bowball was within a foot of our stern, but the girls did exactly what they'd been told to do: keep their eyes in the boat, wait until I told them to push, and then just step off the crew behind. New Hall's overlap forced me to play the set-piece "floating" push into First Post to avoid being bumped. Ten strokes "for Ellie" gave us a metre or so of breathing space, and the girls pulled their hearts out to help me with the cornering and just trample New Hall into the ground. Our trademark push out of Grassy was, yet again, phenomenal and with Selwyn now only half a length ahead, things were hotting up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Unfortunately Pembroke "won" their spoons just outside the Plough which meant I had some rather interesting chicanes to deal with, but the boat sat up and coming into Ditton I knew we'd done enough. The gutsy rowing up the Reach, whilst not the most tidy performance ever, had so much heart and soul in it that New Hall collapsed over the finish line over 4 lengths behind us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Getting thrown into the Cam once back at the boathouse was a less than pleasant experience, but I didn't put up a fight because I was so proud of the girls for what they have done the whole term, which was just epitomised by that row today. Ellie came to see us and nearly everyone was in tears. The team spirit this crew has is just so unutterably fantastic, each of us can rely on every single other member of the crew. They trusted me to keep New Hall off our stern and they simply got on with the job. Not once did I look behind; never did I have any doubts that my girls would just never give in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
This crew is the first Queens' 1st Lent VIII to bump up and not get bumped since 1994. It's been a long time coming, but I think we're about to see the dawning of a new age of QCWBC. Bring on the Mays...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<result>bumped by corpus I</result>
		<report>We knew what we had to do. With revenege against jesus II a possibility we went at it hammer and tong. We knew that corpus behind us were on for blades and we didn't want that (Ian more than most). &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Another good start let us hold station until the end of the legs ten, when corpus started taking ground. At first post corner they were about a canvas away, but we didn't give in. A big push (and yet another impeccable line) saw us pull away, until grassy when they really worked hard to bump us. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Overall it was dissappointing to go down three. Admittedly we were bumped by two first boats (one of which got blades) and jesus II, but being bumped is not a nice feeling. Nonetheless the crew never once gave in. The crews which bumped us had to work hard, and we can be proud that we're still one of the highest second boats on the river. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

		<result>Depends on who you ask.... BUMPED Pembroke II</result>
		<report>We went out with revenge in mind today, our row down was indeed sexy, pauses at arms away on the tail of Corpus I beasting it for all they are worth! Our start was immaculate, we were long &amp; strong, and slowly creeping up on Pembroke II, but Corpus I were creeping up on us too, and we had to push for all we were worth to keep them off us, we pulled some great rowing out of the bag when it really counted. Some great steering from George kept them at 3 whistles and when they got overlap on us we squeezed them off several times. It became evident that Pembroke II were getting pretty tired, we did a red line push as they caught a crab, and ploughed into them pretty hard just before first post corner, we had bumped them back, it was all over, or so we thought! Corpus didn't hold it up behind us, and nearly snapped George in half with their bow's blade, but we disentangled ourselves eventually, only for the umpire to say that Corpus has already bumped us under the motorway bridge! We were livid, they hadn't so much brushed us, they hadn't got us, yet the umpire decided to give them the bump, and Pembroke II pushed off the bank &amp; carried on rowing! The umpire then decided to ride off as fast as his little legs would carry him, before our bank party (&amp; cox) could chase him down. It wasn't a case of it being a tough call &amp; the umpire having to make a hard decision, he was just plain wrong. And Pete Convey (who wasn't there) backed him up as per usual. That made 2 bad calls against us in 2 days, you could tell we had nothing but rage in our muscles as we rowed home, proabaly our best stretch of rowing yet. We don't deserve to be back in sandwich boat, we rowed ourselves out of the 3rd division fair &amp; square. Bring on the Mays, revenge will be ours, we have the bloodlust!</report>

		<report>We started strongly today, holding Girton at a length behind us and pushing them away after the motorway bridge as they started to tire. We were settling into a good rhythm and looking confident for the rowover, when a broken seat brought us down to rowing in sixes. Girton quickly closed and made the bump. We've been unlucky this bumps- the result doesn't reflect the power in the crew, but we've had fun and are looking forward to bumps dinner tonight!

		<result>4th of 4 doubles in a time of 11:44</result>
		<report>The row up to the start was relatively without incident, though our 
arch nemesis (the barge opposite Emma boat house) created a brief hold up. 
We decided not to get out of the boat after spinning by the lock, for fear 
that getting back in might prove difficult. We were faced with a cold wait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The rolling start went well, picking up speed from a standstill 
effortlessly. Little did we know we would complete 4 more starts before the 
course was complete. In our final (and first) outing we had practiced a 
seamless rate-build, though under the pressure of the race we never quite 
reached the dizzying heights of 26 demonstrated the day before. We 
immediately pushed off the Jesus girls in the double behind, as we sped 
down first post reach. The bank gradually approached our bow-side. 
Unfortunately the perfect racing line we had anticipated into the gut soon 
brought about a restart, and offered the crew behind a free 5 lengths to 
get them underway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We pushed back off the girls, and were remarkably central around grassy, 
but once again disaster struck as we tried to cut the corner around ditton. 
Our first push down the reach was exemplary, balancing well, at times our 
blades were even clear of the water. But about half way down (sensing a 
pattern) our rhythm was brought to a premature end by a collision. By this 
stage the girls were on a roller coaster of emotions, as they took 5 
lengths off us once more, only to have us steal them back effortlessly 
before our next crash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The red line push off the railway bridge ended predictably. This time, we 
were particularly unlucky because a bush prevented our quick escape from 
the bank, and the girls' bank party were calling to overtake. This was an 
impossibility. We were the faster (albeit less technical) crew - we just 
needed some open water to prove it. We opened the gap from 1 length to 
around 4 within the 200m or so to the finish, demonstrating what might have 
been if only our steering had matched our balance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

All in all, not exactly a proficient debut to sculling, but a very 
enjoyable one. Thanks to everyone involved, especially Nick, Jon, and the 
Jesus girls for some friendly competition.</report>

		<result>3rd of 4 doubles in a time of 11:16</result>
		<report>After months of intense preparation for this event myself and Jon felt we were ready. 30m before the startline we began to lay down full pressure. The rating leapt up to above a blistering 22. A powerful zig-zag down the first post reach saw us maintain our position next to a jogger on the bank. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Before we knew it the gut had come and gone and we found ourselves in the bank having come out of grassy too wide. Some hasty pushing off saw us recover, but the jogger had taken the lead again (and tied HER shoe laces). We settled back into our agressive race pace (22) and powered on. This time a better line round ditton saw us pottering our way up the reach. We were able to focus on rowing a bit more and less on steering and put some boat lengths into the jogger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I then kind of forgot about the steering and we started to get quite close to the bank again. From the railway bridge we 'red lined'. Bizarrely the boat really started to move well and sat up nicely. Steering continued to be an issue but we had a good last bit to the race. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Awesome fun. The first of many sculling races to come I hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<report>&lt;b&gt;..........TAXI FOR BISHOP!!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The race began at 10.20pm on Friday evening in deepest darkest Cornwall. After being turned away from the airport, in a desperate quest to make the HORR, the 'Big Bish' boarded a bus bound for Plymouth. The road to London was halted at Taunton. Unable to make it to the tideway by any other means he hailed a taxi!!! An exquisite line by the driver and a well timed push out of junction 23 on the M4 saved the day for QCBC. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(All that effort payed off. He was first to arrive, pitching up on the embankment at 6.00am.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
The race proper .......... (Justin had now been on the move for more than 12 hours!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our start was solid. We wound to 34 (maintaining 32 through most of the race) and resisted an attempt by a Newcastle University crew to jump us on the start. Although they started a matter of metres behind us we held them and pulled away to around one and a half lengths by the finish. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Between Chiswick and Barnes we implemented the race plan effectively. A solid rhythm was established and we focused upon length. After Barnes the technical focuses (and the crew behind) kept our minds on the job and our rowing remained clean and efficient. Going under Hammersmith Bridge we executed our third quarter push and the boat speed stepped up. The crew in pursuit began to break as we reeled in the crew ahead. As we rounded the bend we were hit by a massive headwind and the boat seemed to come to a standstill. The rating dropped a little but crucially our technique held reasonably well. Although afterwards we felt that we could have dealt better with the conditions, we had coped better than those around us. Coming past Craven Cottage we sprinted for the finish, pulling away from our pursuers as we passed the embankment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The day ended in the LRC bar. Justin arrived safely back in Cambridge (his 22 hour marathon was over)- legend!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A satisfactory end to a fun term's rowing. Well done guys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
Bring on the Mays - beware the rampant Boar!   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;IK&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We set off agressively and rowing well. The crew behind started only feet behind us and we pushed off them to a few lengths by the end. Coming under Hammersmith we gave it everything intending to blast it round to the finish. A few hundred metres from the bridge we hit a bloody savage headwind. We coped better than the crews around us but it made the last 5 minutes excrutiating. The embankment couldn't come soon enough. All in all a fun days racing with a solid result to show for it :)&lt;br&gt;

		<result>Lost to Clare, Beat Emma 2, Beat CCAT, Lost to St</result>
		<report>Bedford started out badly for us. We never hit a good rhythm in the first race and we just didn't have the work going down in the water. Clare moved past us fairly easily and we hauled a heavy stressed boat to the line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 2nd race was the same; a real disappointment. Our start was slow and we settled into a scrappy tense rhythm. It didn't help that Emma 2 were having a terrific race and were right beside us the whole way. We won, but it wasn't in the least convincing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Our race against CCAT was a turning point in the day's racing. We'd talked alot before the race about how we wanted to row. Relaxed, powerful etc.... Right from the start we moved up on CCAT and opened up a big lead. It became apparent early on that we were quicker and it really relaxed the crew. We found a good rhythm and the middle of the race was great fun as we just pushed the opposition away and floated up the slide. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The last race of our day was against St. Edmunds Hall from Oxford. Feeling pleased with the last race, and knowing they were a similar speed we wanted to generate the same relaxation and power we'd had before. We had a poor start and dropped half a length very quickly. With the staggered start this meant that we were only marginally ahead. We then found a solid rhythm and started moving past them. At the half-way point of the course we were up by about half a length and rowing fairly well. A few bad strokes, and a loss of some power rapidly changed that. We slowed and St. Edmunds got brave. As we came past the enclosures St. Edmunds sprinted and started moving fast. We red-lined and took the remaining speed off the boat in a brilliantly ineffective push. We lost by a few feet. A gutting way to finish the day, but we'd learnt a lot from the racing. So in that sense the day was entirely worth it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
St. Edmunds went on to lose to Jesus by a length in the finals of the plate (15 seconds slower than the race they'd won against us...).

		<report>Well, the first race of May term for the crew, and unfortunately already with a sub! Di Neely was yet again a life save for the crew, as Fi's back meant that she was advised not to row for the weekend. None-the-less, the crew was still fit and ready to put up a fight. 

Round 1:
Pitted against "several blues pembroke", who were tipped to go head of the river, and starting on the inside of the bend (and therefore over a length behind), we realised that us winning would be almost miraculous. Of course we didn't go in thinking this; we'd spent a lot of time and energy improving our technique in the short time we'd been together, and it had definitely paid off. The start, however, could have been better, and it wasn't long before we realised that we weren't going to catch them. However solace was found by the fact that our time was still better than we'd expected.

Round 2: Magdalen College, Oxford.
If we were going to win a race today, this would be the one. Psychologically it helped knowing that they had achieved a time similar to ours for their first race against kings, and this time WE started on the outside and therefore had the advantage. Winning seemed to be an attainable goal, and we appeared to hold them for the first 300m. However the gap began to close, despite our efforts, and magdalen squeezed out enough length per stroke to steal the win from us.

Overall we know we benefitted from the day, despite not making it past the plate round. Training officially ended after this race as we all headed to the bar to "rehydrate" and carb up with chocolate cake. What can I say, true athletes.

		<result>Lost to Eton B, lost to Bedford School A</result>
		<report>After a 5am alarm we arrived at Bedford before our boat had left. Some efficient rigging enabled M1 to complete their first round race on schedule, so Nick and Percy could double up in replace of the Finchinator/Wave-machine engine room. 

&lt;p&gt;Round 1: 
&lt;p&gt;The side-by-side appeal of regatta racing had evidently passed the organisers by, who chose to stagger the start to account for the bend on the course. Unfortunately we had the inside lane which meant that Eton started around one and a half lengths ahead of us, providing something of a psychological disadvantage. The start itself was awesome, we found the length in our wind strokes which had been missing in training, and consequently closed on Eton by half a length. We were able to row our own race, but never regained the deficit of the start around our bend, and coming out of the stone bridge, Eton’s push was more effective than ours, allowing them to kill the race there and then. We finished around 3-4 lengths down having rowed solidly. Unfortunately, the call to wind it down once Eton had crossed the line left the boat in disarray, and we spidered embarrassingly across the finish to the amusement of the enclosure. 

&lt;p&gt;Round 1, Plate: 
&lt;p&gt;With Rich Moore in for Percy at 6, and Nick once more taking the 5 seat, we were confident we could repeat the start we had against Eton. This time it was against Bedford A in the plate, whose Empacher was a formidable sight on the start line. The start provided the same energy and length as the first race, and this time we took more water around our bend. This second row was more composed and consistent than the first, but lacked some of the energy over the first 500m. We crossed the line around two lengths behind, having rowed well but beaten by another well drilled crew. 

&lt;p&gt;Despite the results, the performance was very promising. Two composed starts at rate 42 were sufficient to take water off two very experienced school crews in what should have been their part of the race. If we can transmit length through the stride into the rest of the race, bumps will look very promising indeed.</report>

		<report>I think this was a fairly text book case of how NOT to get to the start line of a race. Due to Dan's injury, Ed Adams kindly stepped in to sub for him. Sean was also away and so James stepped in for him. Yet the subs didn't stop there, they kept coming...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Rafael was desperately trying to get back from London to Cambridge. With his mobile phone battery dead and no other way to get in touch we waited on the hard wondering whether he'd be here in 5 or 50 minutes. Eventually we decided we had to push off. Rowing past Champions VIIIs boathouse we picked up Katie as our bow-woman. Mixed VIII time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We rowed to the start with Ian on the mobile trying to get through to Rafael. It became apparent that he wasn't coming and so we decided to take the race on as it was and try and beat some colleges. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The start was agressive and high. We settled lower than we normally would have with the plan of being able to row more together with rhythm. The course came and went and before we knew it we were pushing for the line. We owe a HUGE thank you to Katie for stepping up and helping us out - and for all the girls on the bank for their shouting. We beat a few colleges, but our main M1 rivals were 20s ahead of us. Three weeks to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<report>The weather was inclement but the performance was good. This race had been built up - the last one before Bumps, and a genuine chance to win pots whilst showing the 2nd division that we don't intend on staying there much longer. That said, our idea of a "taper" was to race the course the previous day and bash out a fair few one minute pieces on the way, so the legs weren't quite as fresh as they will be in 3 weeks time, and we had only just settled into the new crew order, with Mae in at stroke after Fi dropped out through injury to be replaced with Di.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
The technical focus was all on getting the blades in quickly and smoothly and then pushing the legs as hard as possible in the first third of the drive. And it worked. Despite a bit of a headwind the boat never really sagged or got heavy, and there was a lot more guts than I have seen from this crew in a while - rather than limping over the line we did it with some good aggression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
The main crew I was concerned about was Darwin, who thrashed us in a head race last term (by half a minute) and who start 2 behind us in Bumps. Needless to say it was a relief to see them come in 20 seconds behind us when the results came out, and it was very pleasing to take the scalps of a number of 1st VIIIs far higher up the Bumps charts than us, including LMBC, Tit Hall, Girton, Christ's and Selwyn. It was also quite nice to beat Trinity Hall 2nd men :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
Overall, a very solid impressive row, and a second pot of the year for the mantlepieces. Bring on the Mays!&lt;br&gt;

		<result>Row Over</result>
		<report>The first strokes of our start did not match up to some of those produced in training, but we wound well. We then began to pull away from Downing and held station with Cats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Coming round first post Cats had begun to reel in Tit Hall, we remained on station. Their bump happened going in to Grassy. Cats cleared and we were told to go tight, but found Tit Hall still rowing on the inside of the bend. They eventually made it to the bank, but our cornering had gone by now. Unfortunately, we caught the Tit Hall boat on the bank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The collision brought us to a virtual standstill and Downing closed to a length. We pushed of quickly and made a decent restart. As we regained our rhythm we began to open up distance on Downing and took ground from LMBC (who were around 3 1/2 lengths ahead at this point). Much our boat speed was recovered and we pulled away from Downing going round Ditton. (When they eventually fell to 1st and 3rd in the Reach they were over two lengths behind).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We rowed over chasing the overbump on LMBC, closing to just under two lenghts by the finish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bumps wouldn't be bumps without some drama for Queens' M1 on day 1. Having said that todays performance was below that which we are capable of. Tomorrow we will return sharper and go after Tit Hall! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ian Keefe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We'd planned this as being quite a likely scenario to occur - Catz bumping out early. As such, we went for the overbump with massive determination. Due to Trinity Hall doing the opposite of what was being shouted from the bank we crashed into them coming out of Grassy. After the collision we regained our composure, pushed away from Downing (with their rather excitable bank party) and found an agressive pace down the reach which saw us move to 2-3 lengths clear before Downing were bumped. Even with the crash we closed LMBC down to a length and a half.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick Barsley&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This race was like the England Paraguay game in that we were rowing far from our best, yet still managed to pull off a good result opening up a large lead on Downing and closing in on Maggie.  Thankfully, the Trinity Hall crew are all OK after being struck by our blades, so we can give them a good clean race on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jon Finch&lt;/b&gt;</report>

		<result>Bumped St. Catherine's</result>
		<report>After a hard terms training, and many a practice run up to the bumps (including well planned and much needed toilet stops!) the Queens' 1st VIII ladies finally got their chance to do it for real. After a surprise ambush from an experienced Kings crew in last years Mays, we found ourselves relegated to second behind St Catz at the top of the second division. However, unprecedented success at Champs Regatta 3 weeks ago gave us full confidence that we were the fastest in this division, and quite rightly too seeing as we should be in the one above (touchwood). 

The row down saw us leave our target, Catz, well behind, and after one slightly dodgy practice start, by the time we came to the second we were ready to show everyone what we are all about. Paul and Dr. Walker were ready and waiting for us on the bank and much to our pleasant surprise, Chris Boswell, coach of two weeks during this term was also there to wish us bumping thoughts...

We had one aim for this race, and it was accomplished elegantly and clinically. The start wasn't the best we've done, but under the pressure of "that bloody cannon" and people shouting and screaming, the first time is not supposed to be! None-the-less we settled into our rythm together and with ease (our rythm being average 37/8 after a start of about 42!) and within seconds Dom was calling a length off Catz. As we responded to more calls from Dom, that quickly turned into half and quarter length calls, but with no change in our rowing; we all kept our cool. Ready to head around Grassy, we had overlap and Catz did hold us there for a few seconds. Dom took a fantastic line, resisting the temptation to steer into them as we might easily have ruined it all, and within inches around the corner we had bumped them!!!!!  Luckily the fact that we didn't clear altogether too well, (resulting in Soph nearly losing her head in a blade clashing incident) DIDN'T result in a fine, so we were able row on and get ready for the next race......

At the bottom of the second division behind Kings, whose times we have been coming ever closer to in races since Peterborough last term, we knew we had to give it our all and invest in the first few minutes. So we did just that. We went off firmly and moved up slightly on Kings, who then moved away. Never-the-less it was reassuring that we held station with them right up until they bumped New Hall out in front at First Post corner. We soon decided that the over bump wasn't going to happen, which was just as well seeing as we  would have been caught up in bumps carnage shortly afterwards!

		<result>Bumped by Emma II</result>
		<report>Knowing that the boats around us were composed of fast crews, including mainly the first boats of weaker colleges, we went into the first day expecting a tough row. The start was composed and energetic, and whistles came somewhat unexpectedly as we closed to less than a length on Girton I coming into first post corner. We made gains consistantly and Girton had no answer. We broke them down the gut, closing to less than a canvas and rowing strongly in the washing machine. Meanwhile, Emma II behind were trailing well off station, which came as a surprise given their strong performances earlier in the season. &lt;p&gt;

The classically bizarre nature of Bumps then hit us hard. LMBC II had bumped out ahead and were parked incompetantly on the inside of grassy corner, with their bows sticking out into the gut. George was forced to take a wide line (as were Girton I in front), and we missed the bump by inches as their stern swung out trying to make the turn. Through some admitedly quick thinking, the Girton cox actually stuck her arm into the water up to the elbow to act as an additional rudder to get the boat round. We were unable to do the same, and parked up on the outside of the bend, only for Emma II to row past for a bump that on the day their rowing did not deserve. &lt;p&gt;

We showed that on our day we are faster than the boats around us, which bodes well for the rest of the Mays. Hopefully we can bump back tommorrow. &lt;p&gt;

		<result>Bumped Downing II</result>
		<report>Today we knew we were ready for this, our row down was powerful, its a big boost to be holding the boats around you at single strokes! 
Starting next to the cannon is always fun, when it went off the first stroke was pretty jumpy, but by the second stroke it was forgotten, and we squeezed out a decent start, if not as good as some of our previous ones. Our stride was probably the best we had done, and by then New Hall II behind us were disappearing into the distance. We put in some really good strokes while Nick and Dr Walker spent an age discussing whether to give us a whistle, we knew it was coming, but Downing II in front got a whistle on Jesus III before we got our first whistle on them. Once it came, we knew not to change a thing, just keep on squeezing, two whistles came for both us and for Downing, several boats were bunching up in front of us, someone was going to bump soon, and we were going to make sure it was us. As we went into first post corner, Hetti went into overdrive, didnt understand a word of the screams, until she squealled "overlap!" at the top of her voice! Our last few strokes werent beautiful as we were rowing in a lot of rough water, but Downing conceded that we had earned our bump, and we managed to pull in on the inside of the corner before anyone behind us approached. It was all over so quickly, we didnt get anywhere near the pain barrier, and rowed home showing off an entire trees' worth of leaves!
Bring on tomorrow!</report>

		<result>Bumped by caius III</result>
		<report>A solid start, although not our quickest, saw us hold station with lmbc IV but lose a quarter  length to caius III behind.  We held position in first post reach, and used the advantage of Lou's tight line around first post corner to push cauis back to a length and a half.  The first whistle on lmbc came on the exit of the corner during a strong push.  We continued to close in, getting the second whistle just before grassy.

Unfortunately, a badly placed jesus crew stopped on the inside of grassy forced Lou to go wide.  Having lost our line, we were unable to recover and colided with a stationary darwin crew on the exit of grassy, followed by the agony of seeing caius row past for the technical bump.

Despite this, there is much to be encouraged by.  Our rhythm settled to a pacy 34 which we all felt we could have sustained, while crews around us were dying.  Cauis must be unsettled by their technical bump, and we will have them firmly in our sights tomorrow afternoon.</report>

		<report>A row-over today, which was disappointing. Chasing a fairly 
well-matched crew Caius II, and pulling in on them to less than a quarter 
of a boat length, was not enough: New Hall III's flakiness (involving 
simply stopping rowing around First Post Corner) gave Caius II the impetus 
they needed and allowed them to bump out quickly. Fitz II were miles behind 
us, which meant a fairly easy row-over (if row-overs can ever be descibed 
as such!) but alas no glory today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<report>Coming into the race, we knew that the most difficult day would be this one, as we had to bump what looked to be a reasonably quick Jesus VI - the rugby team, as I found out later on. Our start was a little bit panicky, due in large part to unfavourable weather conditions. We nevertheless got within a length by first post corner. Unfortunately, they did a massive push off of this corner and quickly bumped the crew ahead of them. We had hopes for an overbump, but all the boats ahead bumped out and we had to settle for a boring row-over, keeping the Wolfson crew chasing us comfortably distant (about 5-6 lenghts at one point!).</report>

		<result>Got on</result>
		<report>A good race for everyone, in terms of both technique and amount of physical effort. Pernille did an excellent job of getting us to our top boat speed before crossing the starting line - we wound up to about 44 before settling down to a very aggressive 37-38 pace.

After the first 3 minutes, the boat speed died down a bit, probably because, as a crew, we were not used to sustaining the level of pain associated with the start of a 2k race. But thanks to Rafael shouting from the bank at this point, we picked up our speed just before grassy corner.

The last part of the race, from ditton corner to the finish lane, was the most memorable and painful of all. As soon as we made the last corner, it seemed like we all could smell the finish line; we started pushing harder and the boat started to move nicely. Halfway down the reach, Pernille started to call for a final spring by pairs. At this point, the boat started to accelerate with every single stroke we took. It was, all in all, an appropriate finish for an excellent race. And the result speaks for itself - over 30 seconds faster than the crews that didn't get on.

		<report>After a beautiful push off from Paul, our start was powerful, but not as clean as it might have been. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Contrary to the pre-race 'chat', we powered away from First and Third down First Post Reach. Going into First Post corner we were getting the whistle. An obstruction on the bank silenced Dr. Walker but we continued to reel in Trinity Hall.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

On Grassy we put yesterday's difficulties behind us. Our corner was well executed and we took more ground from Trinity Hall. By this point First and Third were well off station.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The bump came on the exit from the corner. We pulled in satisfied, the 'Robin Walker' had had its first bump and so had Raf. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Having said that, once again our rowing did not match up to our high standards. (Our bladework suffered in the washing machine of the gut). Nevertheless we go in to the rest of the week confident that we will step up another level.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Job done today - tomorrow we go for LMBC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ian Keefe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Due to the carnage yesterday, we began the day with a paddle up to the motorway bridge and practised handbrake turns on Grassy.  Morale was consequently very good as we felt well-prepared.  Thankfully we also greased the gates, which meant the boat didn't creak anymore thus ensuring stealthy bumping.  Today's race was much like the England/Trinidad and Tobago game in that we rowed slightly better than the previous race but not at our best and still managed to get the result required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jon Finch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
As Jon said - we got the job done today. We are now at the same height as Queens' rose to in the late 90s. If we bump LMBC we'll be the highest since the 60s. We're going to show what we can really do tomorrow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick Barsley&lt;/b&gt;</report>

		<report>Back where we belong - Division 1!!

Well, day two and another opportunity to get out of our sandwich predicament. Being at the top of the second division in front of Catz meant that rowing over was a chore, (a bit like having to get a mobile phone out of the Patroness' bows before we pushed off!) but we did the job well. Despite being worked slightly harder than we had anticipated, we still had fuel left in the tank after rowing over at rate 34. At least Catz felt they had rowed well behind us anyway!

The second race was the moment of truth for us all; we knew we had to get New Hall, and we knew that we could. Kings had bumped them in the gut on the previous day, but as we knew we had the whole course to get them we didn't need to invest ALL our efforts in the first part of the race. So after a clean start we started to move up on the crew ahead right from the cannon, with some strong and intelligent rowing. As we came around first post corner, we had the bump in sight, which spurred Dom on to make our "top secret" call (!?) to push for it, and the boat LITERALLY flew into New Hall. WE DID IT GIRLS!!!!!!</report>

		<result>Bumped by Darwin</result>
		<report>We were fully aware that despite having pulled away from Emma II on the first day, before the incident around grassy, bumping back would not come automatically. Somehow though, our start did not have the same dynamism or urgency as on the first day, and we began to wait for whistles which never came. Having pulled off station from the heavier Darwin I crew behind, they gradually reeled us back in, closing to a length down the gut. &lt;p&gt;

In fact our rowing under pressure from grassy onwards was the best of the day, though Darwin continued to close to around a canvas by the Plough. The damage had been done earlier, by our lack of agression off the start. By Ditton they had overlap, and we admirably forced them to work for the bump, holding them off until half way down the reach. A bump back is not an impossibility, but we will need to hit it harder earlier if we are to learn from yesterday. Our row on the first day demonstrates that we have a turn of pace which can frighten the boats around us. Tommorrow we will need to convert into a more confident and aggressive performance.

Our row down was spectacular, we had never been so balanced when we easy, but today we really got the hang of scaring the living daylights out of the competition with huge smacks as we dropped our blades onto the water, a bit of intimidation always helps!

Our start was composed, even after the delay to the canons. Our stride was strong, and it wasnt long before we hit the choppy water, and knew a whistle was on its way. Jesus III got some whistles on Catz II, but once we had our whistles, we reeled them in a stroke at a time. Some big strokes from me &amp; Ness got us round first post corner and before we knew what hit us, we hit them! We just about managed to keep a lid on the excitement until we pulled in! </report>

		<report>A solid push-off from James gave us a cleaner start than yesterday, although again not as fast as the crews around us.  Cauis moved quickly away, never settling, resulting in an early bump on lmbc.


We found our rhythm quickly after the stride, and started putting water between us and Sidney II.  Our pace felt light and fast, and we resigned ourselves to the rowover rating 34.  Excellent steering by Lou saw us take good lines around first post and grassy, and we pushed well into and out of each to ensure that sidney were never going to be a threat.  We passed catz who'd bumped at the exit of grassy, so knew that any hope of the overbump was gone.


Coming around ditton, we were about 10 lengths ahead of sidney, and continued to push away down the reach with our rating dropping to 32 and then 30 coming under the railway bridge.  We recovered our rhythm to cross the finish line in style.


We're back chasing lmbc tomorrow, and are keen for the bump we deserved on day 1.</report>

		<report>This was a textbook case of how not to approach a bumps race. Though we knew we were faster than the Emma crew ahead of us, there is no such thing as an 'easy' bump; you have to work for it! We lacked this mentality throughout this race and when, after we came withing half a length of them 3 times before being pushed away, people in the crew got restless, we all committed one of rowing's mortal sins: looking behind to see how far the other crew was. At the end of the day, we had to contend with a very dissatisfying row-over. The overall learning experience, however, will be useful for all of us. </report>

		<report>A slightly scrappy but aggressive start saw us settle into a solid race rhythm. We coped better today with the bad water in the gut and moved well round Grassy. Coming past the Plough we had closed on LMBC. Coming round Ditton we were perhaps down to 1/4 length. The crew felt strong and the rhythm was stable and aggressive, but maggie put in a big push which we didn't counter in time and the momentum of our earlier gains were lost. Coming out of the railway bridge we put in another push and closed on them again, but not by enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick Barsley&lt;/b&gt;</report>

		<result>Row Over</result>
		<report>.... And a bloody gutsy one at that. The day started with a few more nerves than had been felt in previous races. With a long history between Selwyn and QCW, the pressure mounted from ourselves and outsiders' expectations, especially as all other Queens' boats had bumped up in the divisions before! A sense of deja vu was also felt as Di had been struck down by food poisoning (let's torch dojos!!) but luckily we were able to call up the very able Fiona McDougall, who has already been apart of this crew this term. The row down was not as strong as other days so far, but rowing behind Catz at single strokes for the majority of the time was successful in at least lifting our spirits, if not expanding our heads. 


The real start was an improvement on the practices, and the race began strong. We held station on Selwyn after a brief move up by a quarter of a length, which we continued in bursts around first post. However, carnage on the river and a wide but very good line and recovery later, we lost our rhythm slightly. We continued the push to move up on them, even if it wasn't as focussed and planned as we'd have hoped, and the reach was arguably some of the most determined rowing we've ever done. However overlap was obviously not enough to phase Selwyn who pushed away from us, making the most of our wobbly moments. But, heads up guys, because we have unfinished business in this war- Let's get 'em tomorrow!!!! (and now a message from Ben Bouquet:GOOD WORK BOATIES!!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

		<result>Bumped Darwin</result>
		<report>Something of a carbon copy of the first day's racing, except this time we were on the better side of things. &lt;p&gt;

We started agressively, but perhaps sacrificed some of the clean rowing we had exhibited on Wednesday. We closed on Darwin I, getting to a length entering first post corner. However, their power began to show through and they dropped us to around two lengths down the gut. Chruchill II behind meanwhile, never really got beyond station. &lt;p&gt;

Coming into grassy, we heard shouts from the bank that boats had cleared to the inside of the bend. In exactly the same situation as Wednesday, George was forced to take a wide line to avoid them, and Darwin ahead did the same. This time, Darwin befell the same fate as we had done previously, and ploughed into the bank. Having practiced "emergency corners", learning from Wednesday, we were able to exectute well and steer clear through some excellent coxing by George, thereby passing Darwin's bow and making the bump. &lt;p&gt;

It was obviously unfortunate from Darwin's perspective, and they will undoubtedly be out for revenge on Saturday. However, we can find some poetic justice in making a bump through the same circumstances in which we lost one on Wednesday. We had practiced for such a scenario and the extra work came good. Girton is the target for tommorrow - we showed them our speed on Wednesday, and with a fast Darwin crew behind, it is set for a close battle.

		<result>Bumped Downing 2</result>
		<report>Today we had to try pretty hard to keep a lid on the excitement, but we managed another strong row down to the start with plenty of inimidation tactics involved! Our general aim was to row well (it seemed a sensible idea all round), and give our race 100% effort. We definately acheived this!

The gun was almost quiet now we had moved 2 stations away from it, and our start was pretty composed and strong. From the outset Jesus III didnt pose much of a threat, we had our hearts set on Downing II (again!), and gave each stroke a lot of committment. We took first post corner well, and got our first whistle soon after, grassy corner was also put behind us without any trouble (well done Fran &amp; Livs, first corner of the week!), and as we approached the plough we were getting closer &amp; closer, we nearly had them going into the corner, but a big legs 10 coming out of ditton sealed the deal! Hetti had called so many great pushes, we were going to make sure this push was the last one! 

A brilliant effort all round, we gave it everything we had, and kept going until the job was done. We now know we have what it takes to make a long bump, and we know we will go for our 4th bump tomorrow with even more conviction! </report>

		<report>After two exhausting row-overs, our pace for this race was somewhat conservative. We did, however, hold station with Emma until just before the railway bridge. At this point, it seemed that Emma became ever more tired, while we found new energy reserves in our resolve to make up for the previous day's mental lapses. The bump came just after the railway bridge; it was a great feeling for most of us, who hadn't experienced a bump before. </report>

		<result>Row Over</result>
		<report>Although it ended in a row over, today was one of the most exciting bumps races i have been involved in.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
We went off hard and so did LMBC. We remained on station throughout the first half of the course. In the  Long Reach Maggie mounted a push which saw them to begin to move away. This time we responded, our canvas pushes kept taking the boat speed up. LMBC began to tire and we started to grind them down. By the finish we were within half a length.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Satisfyingly, we had wiped the floor with First and Third. We were also faster than Maggie - just not quite quick enough for the bump!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Speaking to LMBC afterwards, it became clear that both sides ended the campaign satisfied after an epic battle. We will meet again at Henley on Friday where will have the chance to prove ourselves the faster crew.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
I am very proud to have been a member of this crew. We certainly didn't go into bumps 'looking over our shoulders' and hopefully our performance may go some way to silencing some of our detractors. We ended the bumps as high as Queens' has ever been since 1968. The challenge now is to consolidate our top six position and firmly establish QCBC amongst the big boys!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; 
I have enjoyed the year, and this term in particuar, enormously. I must thank Rob Jeffrey, Paul, Dr. Walker and everyone who has coached for their invaluable contributions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Henley will be the last time in a Queens' boat for a number of us and we will be looking to out with a bang!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ian Keefe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;In contrast to Friday's race, LMBC didn't give us anything off the start and handled the corners flawlessly. Coming round first post we got a huge roar of support from the QCBC Pimms Tent where many of our parents / alumni were watching. A good line from Ian, Sean and Jon around grassy saw us set up well for our burn down Plough reach. However, despite rowing well and attacking, by Ditton we'd dropped to about 2 1/2 lengths back from LMBC and things weren't looking as promising as they had yesterday. Amusingly 1st and 3rd were no-where to be seen - despite a wonderfully optimistic whistle from their bank party. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Building on Friday's near miss of a bump we'd practised an all-out push to take the rating up and end the race. Coming out of Ditton, and so far back, Ian made the call to do it anyway. The rating leapt from an OKish 35 to over 40 and settled to 38, from where it didn't drop for the rest of the race. From here we really started to move on LMBC. By the railway bridge our bank party was starting to get excited and we got a whistle (albeit an optimistic one we found out later). Ian called our finishing push again and again and the boat speed just kept coming up and up. We finished 1/2 a length down on maggie. The disappointment not to catch them was there, but it was such a good race and we knew we'd given everything to it. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
One last thing I'd love to add is that Queens', for two (nearly three) years now, have been definitively faster than 1st and 3rd. We finished 2 1/2 lengths clear of them. In complete contrast to 1st and 3rd's attitude - LMBC came across the whole week as being very sporting and great opponents.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
LMBC are also going to the Henley Qualifiers.... :-) With Neil, Rich and Ian all convinced were even faster this year than last year - hopefully we'll find those extra 5 seconds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

		<result>Bumped Selwyn</result>
		<report>The fourth day, and our final chance to get the bump on Selwyn, a crew who has escaped this event many times in the past two years. Focus (and nerves!) was at an all time high, but the energy was invested wisely, and the row down was probably one of our strongest yet. Unlike the previous day, we went in with a plan of attack on Selwyn; we knew we had to chase them strategically and wear them down with well timed pushes, but we also knew it may take the whole course to do this. 


The start was no better or worse than what we had done before, but it was clean and tidy enough for us to remain on station. The first push off the railway bridge took off only about a quarter of a length, but we held that distance before the next push on first post corner. By the time we'd passed the raucous that was the Queens' Pimms tent crowd, our second push saw us at half a length. The rowing itself was not our prettiest, but the strength and balance that was slightly lacking from the day before was definitely back with a vengeance, which was matched with our determination to get that bloody boat! Grassy was equally gutsy; it had to be to stop Selwyn from pushing off us, but by then we'd successfully worn them down so that by the time we were on Plough Reach, our final "loose cut" (our secret weapon call) was enough to turn overlap into bump 3 of 4 days, right on ditton Corner. The row over on Friday was soon forgotten, as was Saturday night after just a couple of glasses of champagne (which was unwisely followed by countless bottles of wine, port and a few snakebites hehe). An amazing May Bumps wiith an amazing crew of "big strong girls"- thanks everyone- QCWBC is going up up up!

		<result>Bumped by Darwin</result>
		<report>Having bumped Darwin in fortunate circumstances on Friday, but having been bumped by them on the reach on Thursday, we aware that we would be under pressure from behind. Darwin had demonstrated that they were able to grind us down over distance of the course, but on all days of racing, as the lighter crew, we had dropped them by nearly a length off the start. In front, we knew that we had the boat speed to catch Girton, who we had taken to overlap on the first day around grassy. It was therefore a case of bump or be bumped, and we planned the race accordingly. &lt;p&gt;

We hit a record high off the start, and settled to a blistering 42 coming around first post corner, which given our starting position near the lock, was well over 2 minutes into the race. It was not as clean as it could have been, but we justly sacfriced some efficiency to vastly overrate the crews around us, and the boat felt light. We had a canvas on Girton coming around first post corner, and at our rate of approach, things almost looked good for a glorious bump outside the QCBC Pimms Tent. Spurred on by the huge support from the bank, we closed to overlap at the beginning of the gut, and had opened way beyond station on Darwin. &lt;p&gt;

Controversy ensued (as usual). Coming into grassy we had signifcant overlap and another foot or two may have afforded us a bump under the new rules on the bow ball passing the leading boat’s cox. Our bank party called for Girton to concede when our bow rode over their stern and apparently hit it. The concession however never came, and all three umpires claimed to have seen nothing. &lt;p&gt;

Whether we in fact made the bump or not is perhaps by the by. We should have killed it their and then and climbed their 7 man's rigger (and will do so in future). But it was not unsuprising that past grassy Girton began slowly to recover, and Darwin came up on us. We had prepared for that in the race plan by going for the bump early. Once Darwin got up to speed, we knew we could not match their power, and they ground us down, commendably bumping halfway down the reach as they had done before. However we had executed our race plan perfectly, going off hard and knowing that we needed the bump before the plough because even in the first division, let alone the second, a 40+ rate could never be sustainable. &lt;p&gt;

If an umpire's decision cost us the reward, it is unfortunate, but I do not wish to take anything from Darwin who were the faster crew over the course, and justly deserved their position over the Mays as a whole. We must learn for next time that there is no scope for mercy, and finish the job with more clinical precision. Girton should consider themselves fortunate, but they also showed admirable determination to pull away, and I am prepared to believe that they were genuinely unaware of any contact if was made. That’s just bumps. &lt;p&gt;

Nevertheless, we rowed ourselves proud, and can take a great deal from our performances over the week. It has been a privilege to row with this crew - I hope to see as many as possible back to row next year, and have no doubt that with continued training, many have the potential to make the step up to M1 for the Mays 2007. &lt;p&gt;

		<result>Bumped Trinity Hall II</result>
		<report>Our nerves were definately not under control today, Id be surprised if we managed to get more then one proper nights sleep between us last night.... but it didnt show by the time we got in the boat, yet another brilliant row down, we knew we were faster than the boats around us and we wanted to make sure they knew it too! All eyes in the boat past the crowds, "Corney, 5" is scorched into my retinas forever now! 

Thankfully we didnt have to wait long at the start before the canons, so not long for nerves to build... but the gun went off and all nerves were banished, we knew what we had to do! Our first three draw strokes were wobbly but we got it together well by the winds, and our start was speedy, Downing II were disappearing into the distance by the stride. Me &amp; Ness gave it everything we had to get us round first post corner, and our line was spot on, we had whistles once we had passed the queens tent, and our push out of the corner was strong. As grassy approached, we all had our hearts will bow and three, they gave it absolutely everything, we could all feel the boat spinning round on every stroke, and Fran and Liv got us some more whistles, we knew we could get them now! All of us could feel the conviction going into every stroke, long and loose, we were eating into them simply because we were rowing really well! The bump came in a blur of screams and whistles, "kill kill kill" from Hetti meant that it was now or never, and before you knew it we ploughed them into the outside of grassy in front of all the crowds! 

The sight of 9 screaming girls, Liz crying her eyes out, and our dedicated bank party of Nick, Ian and Dr Walker (thank you so much guys!) leaping all over the bank grabbing greenery was very memorable. We all got a bit hysterical, and managed to get fined £60 for not clearing due to celebrating in the middle of the river... so much for hands on blades til we pull in! We rowed back with huge grins on our faces, the flag trailing in the river (ah well, it was already dirty!), and lots of cheers from many queens supporters on the bank! 

Id like to think there was some great secret to our success, but we just managed to have luck on our side, bumping crews who were gaining on the crew in front before they had a chance to get there first. And we rowed really well, which was after all our great aim for the week! Huge well done to Hetti, for not just making it around the corners (unlike a lot of the rest of the boats this week!), but for doing it in style! A huge thank you to all the members of the crew who had to be convinced that they wanted to row at all (I told you it would be fun!), and another to those who were there through the thick and thin, times when W2 had as few as 5 rowers! Most of all we owe a lot to Liz, who put up with our whinging and incessant chatter, and worked us to the bone, pieces round all the corners, and up and down the reach going faster and faster each time! 

I hope that winning our blades encourages us to continue to work as hard, if not harder, for the continued climb of the unstoppable 2nd women! Power of the boar!

		<report>With a bump on lmbc IV yesterday, we were eager to hand clare III their spoons with another bump today. However, lmbc IV were keen to bump back, and flew off the start, gaining three whistles going into grassy corner. We held them there, learning that the inches really do count, and kept pushing until lmbc IV were bumped off our tail by selwyn III outside the plough, leaving us to focus on the crew ahead. Unfortunately, the frantic start to the race had exhausted us, and having already had a rowover and a long bump, we had nothing left to catch Clare III, who rowed over 2 lengths ahead of us.

Over all, thanks to a good-humoured crew with plenty of experience between 
us and a talented coach and cox, we managed to gain a lot: we probably had 
the potential to go up 4 - I reckon our confidence and realisation at what 
we could achieve was discovered a little too late in the day. However, up 3 
is still a good achievement, especially considering that this is only the

		<result>Qualified for Henley Royal Regatta</result>
		<report>We had a good start and after hitting 48 settled to 42 for our high 15 push. After that we settled into an agressive 38/39. We were determined not to follow the mistakes of other crews and under-rate due to lack of competition. Our race plan was designed around intense pushes to maintain rating and boat speed. Without giving too much in terms of our tactics away the pushes went well and held the intensity we'd started out with. By the enclosures the crew was clearly hurting badly but we sprinted hard regardless and took it to the line. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We came off the water (having pushed off next to Mathew Pinsent and Steve Redgrave!) and waited around like everyone else. After 10 minutes the announcement came for the Temple Qualifiers... Pangborn, Pembroke College Oxford, QUEENS' COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We were all thrilled - we're racing Henley! This week has been full of much deserved May Balls and parties for the crew. With those now over, far more careful preparations will be made for next Wednesday's race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Particular thanks should be given to three individuals. Rob Jeffrey was able to get off work early and helped us enormously in preparing for the race. Andy Dyson and Ed Adams are both new to the crew replacing Percy Hayball and Rafael Mora. Their contributions from the bows were crucial. The boat felt lively and powerful in the water, and they slotted right in seamlessly. Congratulations on getting your white zephyrs and into the Boars Head guys!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

		<result>Lost by 4 lengths to Bristol 'A'</result>
		<report>We were drawn against the seeded crew Bristol 'A' to race at 9:35am on Wednesday 28th June. The day before we met for two outings. The first was to loosen up and get familiar with the boat again and the second was to practise our starts and high rating bursts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Harry was unable to make the first outing and so Justin Bishop stepped up to the mark and subbed in for us. Without his help we'd have been under-prepared for the race and he did a superb job in the 6 seat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

Our outing later in the evening was set in a very different atmosphere from a few hours earlier. The river traffic had died down considerably and there were only a few crews remaining out training. As such we were able to focus far more on our rowing and we reached a quality of steady state equal to or above a standard to which we had ever been before. The evening outing was topped off by a practise start next to a pre-qualified Thames crew. We were relaxed, on the ball and flew out the start at 50. We settled to 42 after 15 high and we'd blown them away by a length in 20 strokes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Sean and his family very generously put us up for the evening and we ate an insane amount of lasagne. The morning drive in went without incident and we found ourselves ready and waiting at 8a.m. by the boat. We warmed up on the ergs, Rob gave us his last words of wisdom before the race, and we boated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The row down to the start was good, but tense. Bristol were an intimidatingly disciplined crew, and we also had a 2 stone average deficit to them. We'd hope this would manifest itself as them being obese and slow... they were all very lean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our start was not our best, but not bad. The high was as agressive as any, yet when we strode we found we'd already lost a length to Bristol. We immediately tried to fight back by putting in our pushes earlier than the plan and taking the rating up. For the whole 2k we threw everything into it trying to reel Bristol back in, but to no avail. Bristol won by 4 lengths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After the race, and after putting the boat away we had time to reflect. We'd rowed the fastest of the three cambridge colleges there that day, and we'd also had a tough draw.... But it was still such an experience. The rest of the day was spent enjoying the amazing Stewards Enclosure (courtesy of Stewards Members: Shailen Majithia, Chris Dalley and John Gordon). It was such a superb end to the year's rowing - and I couldn't recommend it more to future years of Queens' rowers. This is something to really aim for each year. It can be done. Perhaps next year you'll get a better draw and go further than we did!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, a huge thank you from the crew should go to: Ian Keefe for his superb captaincy and Rob Jeffrey for being so generous with his time and making incredible improvements to our boat speed in the last fortnight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick Barsley&lt;/b&gt;

		<result>5th out of 20, 11min 01sec</result>
		<report>Only two weeks into the rowing calendar, and with only three IVs outings to our credit (two of them rowing with macons), we approached the race as a serious training piece rather than a clear opportunity for pots – the first opportunity of the year to test ourselves in clear water. 

&lt;p&gt;The row up to the start felt powerful, and remarkably clean. We felt noticeably more secure in locking on, upon returning to the cleavers after two tough sessions with spoons. George took us up to the start and we made a couple of good winds the rate building smoothly and higher than in practice. The plan for the race was to settle around 28 and then through communication between Rich and George, take it higher if we could maintain efficiency. 

&lt;p&gt;The rolling start took us under the motorway bridge at a good pace, and we settled quite comfortably around 28-30. Chasing us were Downing around 5 lengths down, who appeared initially to roughly hold station. A tight line round grassy put some greater distance between us. In the plough reach the power suddenly surged together, and we closed instantly on the 99s crew in front of us. Around ditton we were one and a half lengths down, and as we hit the headwind, they stopped and we were relatively unphased. George made the call that we had overlap around halfway down the reach, and was pointing us at the corner underneath the railway bridge. His aggressive line forced us on, and we passed them by the railway bridge, now eight or more lengths up on Downing. Outside the P&amp;E we opened up to around one length on 99s, going over at about 30, but seemed to fade a little in the last few lengths before the line.

&lt;p&gt;We pleasantly surprised ourselves with the quality of the row, and recognised plenty of positives to build on. Considering our training had focused on small boats rather than training in the IVs, our result was pleasing: fifth out of the college boats and only 6seconds behind the pace for second place. Christ’s stormed victory by 30 seconds, but we are confident we can close the gap by Uni IVs. AD</report>

		<report>The crew that we had taken to Cambridge Autumn Head was somewhat disrupted in Uni IVs by the timing of our first round draw – the afternoon of Queens’ Ergs. As author of the race software for the Erg Comp, Sean was unable to leave the Fitzpat Hall, and so there was a shuffle round in bow pair to accommodate. Dan Jalalpour came in at 2 and I swapped temporarily back to bow side at bow. 
Consequently the row to the start was our only opportunity to gel as a crew, and the boat inevitably felt less sat than on previous outings. Our first round draw was against Jesus, who we knew would be strong, but like us had devoted more time to small boats than the IV. 

&lt;p&gt;The standing start was frankly terrible, having only done limited practice with Sean in the boat and none of the start sequence with Dan. Jesus opened by about half a length as a result. We settled into a firm rhythm down First Post Reach but were never rowing cleanly. Despite this, at the grassy station we received the call that we were 2 seconds up. Down plough reach confirmation came from Kat Astley on the bank, and the boat began to sit up as we lengthened out. A devastating headwind hit us around ditton (the river had been yellow flagged), but in sitting tall we gained another second or so. 

&lt;p&gt;We appeared to maintain speed towards the finish, but were totally lacking in any killer burst. Jesus by contrast surged for the line from around halfway down the reach, eating into our advantage. Across the line it was close. The senior umpire said that there was less than a second between us (though in our favour), and we had recorded a dead heat. This should have resulted in a re-row, but practical exigencies prevailed. One of the Jesus crew had a practical, and half of our boat needed to return to college to set up for Queens’ Ergs. Consequently their coach suggested a coin toss to decide the outcome. We lost. 

&lt;p&gt;A frustrating way to exit the competition. Whether we could have taken it all the way is an unknown (though perhaps doubtful judging by Emma’s margin of victory over Jesus in the second round), but we can take a moral victory from crossing the line first, even if not by enough to count. 

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the race was not the only close encounter of the day with a Jesus crew. Queens’ First Novices beat Jesus in the final of Queens’ Ergs that night by almost an identical margin (less than one second). In both cases an excellent and very sporting tussle with Jesus BC, and one we hope will blossom into a memorable rivalry as the year progresses…AD </report>

		<result>1st in Final; Fastest Men; Time: 1:32.1</result>
		<report>After more than a fortnight of intensive training and eager anticipation, M1 went into the Queens Ergo Competition confident that they were in the ready to perform at the peak of their potential. The only factor beyond our control was the strenth of the opposition. We anticipated that the highly-charged atmosphere of the event, along with no small amount of adrenaline, would further help out cause. Many of us took every step possible to ensure that we were in peak physical condition for the event; including the sacrifice of a morning outing. 

&lt;p&gt;In a closely contested first heat, we narrowly won our division - though with Jesus, CCAT and Caius in touching distance, we knew that nothing was certain going into the final.
In the final, after a strong start, which saw Tom Welchman post the best individual time, we found ourselves chasing CCAT. With two legs of the race to go, CCAT started to fade. However, no sooner had we overtaken them, that Jesus stormed through into first position, with Caius in hot pursuit. It all came down to the last 500m. Neck and neck for 400m, it became a head-to-head battle of sheer mental determination - as the Jesus rower's split began to fade, Julian Walton's stayed consistently below 1:30 and Queens', after a nail-biting wait, were declared the winners by a margin of less than 1s over 4000m! 

&lt;p&gt;Everyone pushed themselves extraordinarily hard and the win was testament to this. We didn't neglect to note, however, that Jesus College came a threateningly close second. This has only encouraged us to work harder on our technique, which will need to be extremely strong if we are to convert the win on the ergs to wins on the water....DJ

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M1 went into the Queens Ergo Competition not knowing what to expect from our opponents. Regardless of the other crews, we knew what we were capable of thanks to the many 500m practices. Also we had anticipated a marginal increase in performance thanks to adrenaline (although we did not depend on this). Many of us took every step possible to ensure that we were in peak physical condition for the event; including skipping a morning outing. We won the first heat for our division and then went on to take first place in the finals. Everyone pushed themselves extraordinarily hard. Note though that Jesus College came a threateningly close second. This has only encouraged us to work harder on our technique. DP

		<result>10th in Final; Fastest M2; Time: 1:35.9</result>
		<report>Yellow flags on a crisp morning sadly greeted what was likely the only novice crew pondering practice on the day of the ergs competition. Queens' Novice B boat was ready for some water time and ready to tear apart a Concept 2 rower later that day. We were chomping at the bit ready for a fight knowing we had little to lose and that despite some fevers and illness in the crew that we still had a shot of a team time hovering near the 1:36 mark.

&lt;p&gt;That evening, with our splash tops, anxiety, and jaffa cakes, we ran behind the college in silence to warm up, huddled for a few calming words, and then unleashed what must have been the most frightful sight of power and team work for a novice B boat. Queens' took the lead with the beast (aka Richard fastest M2 man) and never let it up. Justin and Chris took residence a few breaths away from the rower's ears and drowned out the power music with a torrential onslaught of encouragement and Boar's head roars. Men pulled off, dragged away by their mates, and the next animal on for 500.

&lt;p&gt;Then we were finished.

&lt;p&gt;A nervous glance around confirmed what we knew must be true. We had won the heat as a team. As M2. We hurt as one, we struggle as one, and we row as ONE. Congrats. Then Justin scrambled for info...murmurs that we had a shot of entering the final...that Queens' novices had done the unimaginable of pulling not just one amazing crew into the finals but TWO into the top 10. 19 A boats had fallen.

&lt;p&gt;Our final race was strong. Some of us sped up, some slowed, some stayed the same. However we broke the 1:36 barrier and confirmed our deserved place in the final while sharing the amazing win of the Queens' A boat.

&lt;p&gt;The boar has been unleashed...

		<report>The adrenaline was pumping a good 2 hours before our race actually went underway. Frequent toilet trips and constant supply of Jaffar Cakes and Sainsbury Bananas kept our prevented our nerves from getting the better of us. Smiles and words of encouragement greeted all rowers of Queens’ boats from everyone at Queens’. Not the time to let anyone down.

&lt;p&gt;Austrian Thomas was at his best that night, pulling off one-liners or moment stopping comments to keep the spirit of the team high.
Leo with his kung-fu style warm up not only warmed up himself but also the crowd outside Fitzpatrick Hall, fascinated by the strange antics of the giant Dutchman. 

&lt;p&gt;The time had come.

&lt;p&gt;On the Erg: 1st minute: brave heroics.2nd minute: Faces flushed with pain and agony. Concurrently faces brimmed with resolute determination and resignation to our fate as rowers. Some, fed up with falling of the ergs, resorted to techniques which minimized the movement of theirs legs, to the shouts of “USE YOUR DAMN LEGS DAMMIT!”

&lt;p&gt;End of Race: We BEAT CHRIST B BY A WHISKER THANKS TO ALEX! Camaraderie and friendship with a common bond in the exhaustion. We are grateful for our coach, George, who despite presenting the event, changed out from his Tux into his coaching gear to cheer the team on when it was our turn. Special thanks goes out to our cox Nikki, who was equally apt at directing the crew both on land as  she is on water. She helped out with all our administration and cheered on every single rower from start to finish, notwithstanding the fact that she had taken part in the competition as a rower earlier as well.

&lt;p&gt;Some crew members had only been on the ergs twice before the competition but still put in a good performances. The apologies at the end by some for not rowing fast enough were completely unnecessary. We gave it our best. AS A TEAM. The Best is yet to be – Fairbairns here we come!

		<report>The first rowing competition that we faced was one that involved neither boat nor water, but rather pure grit and determination. A couple of practices ensuring smooth changeovers and decent times could not prepare us for the unique atmosphere of the event. 

&lt;p&gt;Several delays forced our race later on into the night, only fuelling our desire to perform well. It was a Queens’ event on home turf, and we didn’t want that advantage to go to waste. After warming up in the cold night air, and queuing outside to Fitzpatrick Hall we eventually filed in. We could all feel the energy as we lined up behind our erg. Supporters in the galleries boosted our confidence. The event commentator kept us entertained as we waited more, until he brought us to a silence to start.

&lt;p&gt;With the race finally underway, we each had a job to do: to ‘row’ five hundred metres trying push to the limit of our physical capabilities. The music was blaring and constant motivational shouts came from coach, cox, and fellow team members. Our minds however heard very little in terms of what was being said, more that it was just very loud, and because our focus was on making every stroke count. Our first two hundred metres were always easy; it was the second two hundred where the strain was really felt, before the psychological boost of seeing two digits on the display on the final hundred sprint. The changeovers were seamless, and every man performed well. Our times may have been slightly under our personal bests, but finishing overall seventh in our division made up for this.

&lt;p&gt;Before, during and after the event we became closer as a team, and we knew we could only improve. We were proud to have participated in such an event.

		<report>The race started fast but we didn't really settle at all. That meant that the whole race felt rushed and we couldn't get any power down. Christ's were reeling us in all the way, but a decent push in the gut saw us hold them off for a bit. Nonetheless they had overlap coming out of ditton and in a few wet strokes they were passed and gaining clear water. 

It wasn't a very close race and the obvious mitigation is that it was our 3rd or 4th outing as a crew (and this time with a new cox). We were determined but undisciplined, and it was this that was our downfall. Again an understandible, even forgivable, mistake as it was our first race since June. 

Lots to work on for the rest of term.

Thanks to Ian for subbing in as cox while trialling for CUWBC.

		<report>2nd Fastest College IV (lost only to Kings)

&lt;p&gt;After sitting around for ages at the marshall point the lads excuted their "on a six pence" tap spin in front of Kings College London. We were meant to be chasing Pembroke but that battle was over before the start line as i decided that I was cold enough and wanted to get on with it, so overtook them before the motorway bridge. The cheeky upstarts from Kings followed us round and we had ourselves a good old fashioned stand off. Impressed by our
spin they wanted to put us in our place by blasting out of the start and trying to put pressure on us early. However we floated away from them in plough reach and said "bye bye" to a girls crew before we had gone round ditton.

&lt;p&gt;On the reach we hit an almighty head wind which could have stopped us in our tracks. But we were prepared for this barrage and the boat, considering the conditions felt lively and sat up relatively well. The usual continuous push from the railway bridge into the finish meant that the crew was spent
when we completed the course.

&lt;p&gt;Finishing second out of the cambridge colleges was a good result in what I think was the best row of the term so far. Another plus point was the row back. The lads showed great pride in their low-firm past the boat houses. (Rich even managed a smile for a couple of strokes!) GD</report>

		<report>2nd Fastest College 2nd IV (lost only to Peterhouse II)

&lt;p&gt;Our second race of the term was a greater success than our first and although we were not particularly fast, we rowed our best to date. So that when we climbed onto the bank at Morley's holt, we were all satisfied by our performance.

&lt;p&gt;The winter head was conspicuous for the number of entries and this was certainly clear at the lock where the marshaling was on both
sides of the river and in the middle. A feat I hadn't previously witnessed on the cam. The multiplicity of crews and the number of new
blades was a welcome change to typical uni competitions.

&lt;p&gt;The rolling start for the race was done with very little trouble and little pressure from a very distant women's boat behind us. Thanks must go to Justin for subbing in at stroke, As well as setting an excellent rhythm he managed to live up to his 'wave machine'
reputation having soaked the rest of the boat to a state of saturation only marginally less than falling in. Coming round onto the reach we experienced a strong cross wind, but managed to maintain our calm and produced some of our best rowing this term, settling into a comfortable and increasingly powerful row.

&lt;p&gt;By the finish line of what would have been an uneventful spectacle of a row for most, we were generally pleased with the events of the last eight minutes. Hopefully in future races we can use this solid base to put down more power which many of us felt was lacking here but certainly possible in Fairburns.

		<report>Fastest College Novice VIII (lost to Imperial College London A &amp; B)

&lt;p&gt;The race started decently. Balance was good throughout. Crew was very pleased with the pacing (although speed could have been faster in the drive). Coxing was viewed as good throughout the race. Neither power nor cardio resp were exploited to the extent that one would expect in a race nor was it used to the extent that one would deem realistic for our crew at this point in time. 

&lt;p&gt;For a first race the crew views this a positive learning experience and although there was some general disappointment with power, the crew was pleased with our placing, balance, and the race experience for showing us what to expect.

&lt;p&gt;The Winter Head race foreshadows the successes ahead for the M2 crew. The race started with a roar and ended in much the same way. Feathering, while new to most of us, did not crack our concentration greatly and only a few crabs slowed us down as we burned off our nerves. The pace was strong and expert coxing navigated us around the three turns while we put a boat ahead in our sights. Then the real roaring began. The yells from both cox and crew were clear...we were going to catch up with the boat ahead, steal their girlfriends, and crush their spirits. Of course accomplishing all these points prior to crossing the finish line. The opposing cox yelled cries of discouragement at the slowing crew while we blitzed by. Furthermore, a glimpse at the next boat steeled our resolve to attempt the feat a second time. Then we decided to stop on the bank at full speed to catch our breath. Ok...actually we crashed into the bank. No worries though. Perhaps our finest moment yet, we focussed immediately on the task at hand, and proceeded to show what a racing start looks like. Even with the small navigation error we dramatically reduced the distance between our 2nd target boat. 12th in our division with a race time under 12 minutes with a lot of passion to improve. Rock on with a boar's roar.

		<report>With a last minute sub for Rach who managed to do a somersault off her bike, preparation for Winter Head was less than ideal. After spending a considerable amount of time entertaining the crews around us by completely failing to park ourselves when marshalling (our solution to the problem ended with Lou hanging half out of the boat, clutching some weeds), we settled down to wait for the start. The first half of the race was possibly the nicest rowing we have done all term - the boat was sat, there was power in the water and we settled into a good rhythm. Having struggled to keep the rating at 26/28 in practice it was a bonus to stay at 30 (without dropping) the whole way. As we came onto the reach we hit a huge head wind and it felt as though we were rowing through waves (not helped by being in
the wake of an Imperial men's VIII, which overtook us after Ditton Corner). Nevertheless, we sat up, kept going and responded to Lou's calls - one last push off the railway bridge, and we crossed the line knowing we had given everything we had. A really gutsy row, and one to be proud of. Thanks to Rux for subbing and Bex for cycling 20 miles (!) to come and cheer us on. Roll on Fairbairns! Grace White

		<report>So the morning of our first race, one rower down and a broken boat. Good start there then. After kidnapping the men’s boat, 8 evil penguins and a polar bear set off towards the start.

Homerton Indians were the first opposition. We tried to scare them away with a penguin song and dance at the start, and apparently it worked… they rowed away from us. 
After losing feet, seats (penguins trying to fly) and footplates, we completed the race. Conclusion – men have bigger feet and stealing their boat wasn’t the best idea of the day.

After our win by default being cancelled they found us some opposition….Corpus A. Even Double sided sticky taped feet wasn’t enough to keep our feet from escaping with our ‘legs, legs, legs’ rowing. Despite the many complications we finished strongly, rowing more in time (!).

 Bring on Clare, (but we want our boat back)!

		<report>After many panics on the morning of the race (Bow, Stroke and the boat were all missing in action...) we collected all crew members on the start line, donned our rainbow coloured ribbons and took a deep breath!

Drawn against Homerton II, we pulled off a tidy start, and it would seem that was enough to win it, our opposition ploughed pretty hard into the bank, twice, and we didnt see them for dust! Some nice rowing, possibly the first time we had made it down the reach without stopping!

2nd round, up against Jesus I, tough draw! Another beautiful start, we squeezed half a length in front, but they werent going to give up! They pushed past us (albeit through a few blades...) and that was the last I saw... I was too busy knocking little old ladies into the river for the next few hundred metres of tow path! As my attention returned to the race in hand, Jesus were in front, and the girls looked tired. We pushed for the finish but to no avail. 

A brilliant day, costumes and donuts made the chilly air so much easier to deal with! Lessons learnt for Clare; good starts get you everywhere, and whatever happens, dont panic!</report>

		<result>290th of 478; Time: 21:16</result>
		<report>The trip up to London and trailer loading was remarkably uneventful, almost forbodingly so. There was some classic drama with the Bishop's last minute travel arrangements, which characterise EVERY off-Cam race, even the ones he didn't think he was racing in. We wiled away the journey quickly with some top draw jokes about Rich's recent bodyfat reading (which he did nothing to dispel with his textbook pre race visit to the Burger Van...). On arrival at Putney, trailer unloading went smoothly, despite having to ingeniously replace our missing tressles with kit bags.

&lt;p&gt;The meticulous preparation did not prevent a slightly rushed row to the marshalling point, as the queue for the hard took us by suprise. The boat was never very well sat, but it was mostly attributed to the choppy conditions of the Tideway. That said, the water was considerably calmer than it often is, and with bright sunshine and only modest (albeit head) wind, conditions were actually quite good for a fast time. 

&lt;p&gt;We wound it up before Chiswick bridge, starting in the 250s, much higher than our finishing place last year, and consequently amongst some fast crews. Peterhouse I were a few boats ahead though, which provided an obvious initial target to aim for. The wind was nice, settling at about 30, but the length never came and the ratio was disappointing. The unsettling start was accompanied by (probably because of) a fairly unsat boat - the clean bladework of Winter Head was replaced by the occasional dipping of stoke's rigger into the murky Thames. Perhaps this was down to rougher water than we were used to, but if so the crews around it dealt better than we did, and a pack emerged off our stern which was closing steadily. Around four minutes in at Barnes Bridge, a couple of crews clearly starting well below their station had passed us, but the rest were making slower progress and we were up considerably on our best reference point, Peterhouse. However, as boats began to swarm around us, navigation became very difficult, with many crews competing for the stream. Peterhouse seemed to be weaving a wavey line down the centre of the stream, making them very hard to pass without impeding other crews who were also overtaking us. The ensuing chaos was very distracting and when we found the length and rhythm for a few strokes, it was usually this that quickly broke it down. Coming under Hammersmith bridge, there were some cursory clashes of blades and a refocus was required. The boat did pick up slightly past Fulham Football Ground, but never felt light and the hull never felt the stability we had benefited from in previous races. The push for the line ensured we finished just before an absolute pile up occured behind us, with one four seemingly sideways accross the finishing line.

&lt;p&gt;We finished 80 places and 45secs faster than last year's HORR IV, but we had set our sights higher. The comparison with Jesus I (1min ahead) and even CUW (20sec ahead) was not something we would have settled for at the start. Certainly with regards the latter crew, it can only have been technique rather than fitness that let us down. 

&lt;p&gt;All in all a good day out, but not a good row. Certainly well worth the effort though, and the experience will be invaluable come VIIIs HORR in March. Entering two IVs was a great success, and it would be nice to do the same in future years. With some longer outings under our belt between now and the end of term, bring on Fairbairns... AD</report>

		<report>The spectacle of HORR IV started in the usual way with a paddle up from the Putney Bridge boathouses towards the Mortlake Bridge start line. The day began with a crew reshuffle as Max was ill, so Justin was called in to replace him, but went at stroke to re-distribute the masses. Dominic Mott was at the helm in a special appearance.

&lt;p&gt;The paddle up to the start was mostly continuous and of a good standard. Taking instructions from the marshalls, the crew made their spin to begin to wind it up through Mortlake Bridge, with a target rate of 29. We were all cognizant of the average crew mass versus the designed crew load of the boat, and riggers were adjusted to suit, which proved to be very good foresight.

&lt;p&gt;The Browne sat low in the water throughout the race, making it difficult for all blades to clear the water on the recovery, and with each stroke leading to some amount of water coming into the boat, some strokes more so than others. We were passed by a number of smaller crews off the start, and towards the final quarter, however the agreed race plan was adhered to, with pushes off the bridge and an "empty the tank" call coming as we came alongside the moored boats opposite the boathouses we pushed off from. The crew responded to each call that was made, even on the last push after we had been at race pace for 20 minutes.

&lt;p&gt;The finishing time of 22:44,99 is respectable, however slow in comparison to some other crews. We can rest in the knowledge that everything that was asked for was delivered and that we represented QCBC in another outstanding showing at a premiere event. JB

		<result>2nd of 13; Time: 12:14.9 (5:27.2 to Chesterton)</result>
		<report>After a good set of weekend outings in preparation for Fairbairns, we were confident that a good performance on the day would yield a strong placing. However, it was impossible to tell from the entries which clubs had entered their strongest crews in the IVs as opposed to VIIIs, and so although we were the fastest IV entered from Winter Head, we were uncertain of the competition. 

&lt;p&gt;The weather was overcast but conditions were fairly good, with a light tailwind. Marshalling practically from our hard meant that there was only a short wait for the start - unfortunately due to prior divisions there had been no time for a warm up on the water and our first full strokes of the day were as we crossed the startline. We had planned on an aggressive row, learning from HOR4s that we needed a fast start to build confidence rather than waiting for a third quarter push to take us quicker. 

&lt;p&gt;The start was accordingly punchy, and we found a rhythm quickly. We were rowing long and felt like we were locking on much sooner than we had been in earlier races of the term. We settled to around 30-31 where we stayed for the remainder of the race. The boat was sat stable and we were able to focus on length. As we came under Chesterton Bridge the boat sat up further and we began our best racing of the term. Aside from a couple of dodgy strokes halfway down the reach we executed the aggressive row perfectly, taking it up a couple past Ditton to cross the line at 33. 

&lt;p&gt;The row felt our best of term, and we were confident of a high placing. Looking back at the video though (taken by Nick Barsley bank partying), our rate 30 almost seemed too leisurely - good in that we looked calm coming forwards and had set the ratio nicely, but we wondered whether we could have rated higher, even at the expense of some efficiency. 

&lt;p&gt;The results showed that we had placed second, beaten by FaT by 25seconds. We were pleased with our performance - probably we were beaten by a better crew because it is difficult to tell where we could have found 25secs from based on the performance we had already put in. Perhaps with more water time we would have been able to sustain a race pace at 34, but for the time being that was out of reach. 

&lt;p&gt;All in all a very enjoyable term in the IV, placing 5th, 2nd, (290th), and 2nd. We made some good technical progress which will stand us in good stead for the VIIIs later in the year. Thanks to all the crew for the time they put in this term, I hope to row with all of you again soon.... AD</report>

		<report>What an exciting 2 days of racing! Thursdays yellow flag didnt stop the lower womens boats battling through the wind, although it made for trouble getting the boats lined up to start! We were drawn against Clare II in the first round, pulled off a very tidy start in the wind, and left them messing around trying to get out of the bank a few strokes later, didnt see them for dust. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jesus II knocked out Queens III to meet us in the 2nd round, so we had extra reason to take them down! Another rocking start put us ahead, Jesus then tried to row right into us, causing a crab, but we restarted and zoomed ahead again, holding them at half a length the whole way, pushing off them every time they tried to move up on us!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We met Selwyn III in the quarter finals on Saturday, it was still pretty windy, and we took about 5 minutes to get level for the start. Fortunately we had meadow side and the wind was blowing us into the middle of the river not the bank! A brilliant start saw us move off well, Selwyn ploughed into the bank within a few strokes, and again we didnt have any trouble from them for the rest of the race, they were somewhere on the reach as we crossed the finish line! 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Our semi final against Christs II nearly didnt happen, as their boat was there, left abandoned by their first boat due to boat sharing, but there was no sign of any rowers.... All the rest of the boats pushed off to row to the start, still no rowers... just as the marshalls were ready to award us the win, the crew finally showed up in the nick of time! This time we were rowing the course from finish to start (to speed up the delayed races), so the wind was a tail wind this time! Yet another tidy, composed start put us ahead by half a length off the stride, but not long after, Emma's gate popped open... she calmly put her blade back in, everyone else carried on like nothing was happening, Daisy kept our line and we managed to hold most of our lead. Then Emmas gate came open again, 10 strokes later! She replaced her blade straight away, and on we went, but Christs had caught up now! We gave a huge push off an imaginary railway bridge (the 2/3 mark of the race) and squeezed ahead, it was a tousle for the line, but we managed to hold them to win by about three feet. Well done to Emma for keeping her head in two emergencies!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After a quick session of boat repair in the middle of the river (thanks to the 1st senior men, good job boys!) we fixed the rigger, put strokes seat back on and swapped our cox box for one with some juice left (thanks to the 1st novice men!), we span and lined up for the final straight away, no time to get cold! Yet another immaculate start (we really are pretty good at these by now) put us about 1/3 length in front, we were rowing beautifully, but Selwyn II were a larger crew, and made a big move on us, getting half a length ahead before the railway bridge. But we knew we had a secret weapon, the corner coming up was ours, Daisy took a perfect line into the corner, blades about a foot or so from the bank, and a stunning push off the bridge put us back neck and neck! Both us and Selwyn werent going to give up this close to the end, we fought tooth and nail to the finish line, where the three finish judges leapt down onto the floor to see who won... two of them said dead heat, they had no idea, but one reckoned Queens by about two inches! If it wasnt so dark Im sure they would have suggested a re-row, it was so close! But it was ours, we earned it through some really hard work, brilliant starts, big pushes and some amazing lines from Daisy! 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Well done ladies, we showed Cambridge what we were made of today! </report>

		<report>Drawn against Jesus B - a tough race as going by erg scores alone they were on average 13 seconds faster than us… but then ergs don’t float!!! Despite the yellow flag, the race was still on. After a penguin dance (or two) and some much appreciated Haribo we were ready to tackle Jesus, not to mention the wind!! 

Our start was strong, keeping us in contention - much to our coaches amazement :-P However not long into our stride stokes the crab monster struck. Nevertheless we didn’t let this phase us and got ready for another start which again was powerful. We started eating into Jesus’ lead however we couldn’t quite escape the crab monster, which struck again. This left a big gap between us and they rowed back for an easy win.

With the prospect of two outings before our next race (lets hope the flag is being nicer this time) we will defeat the evil crab monster - Fairbairns here we come.
