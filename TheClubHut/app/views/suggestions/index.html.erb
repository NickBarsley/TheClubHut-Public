<h1>Make Suggestions!</h1>

<p class="dropcap">At this early stage of the site I need all the suggestions and help possible. Having been working on the site for awhile now, its sometimes hard for me to spot things which either don't work, or could work better, or features which should exist. You, the kind person reading this now, are in a great position to help and suggest what you'd like to see. Please write below!</p>

<%= link_to 'New suggestion', new_suggestion_path %>


<%= render :partial => "suggestion.html.erb", :collection => @suggestions %>
